Price is a pathologist whose experiments include shooting up LSD in an attempt
to scare himself. While a little talky, the film's mix of camp and genuine
horror makes for a fun ride. Watch it in HD and the string used to pull the
creature along is plainly visible in several shots. Credit where credit's due:
the third act twist is a good one.

Pathologist Price discovers a parasitic crawler that grows on people’s spines when they’re afraid. A memorable sequence involving a deaf-mute woman proves director Castle can deliver the goods, but the rest of the film pales in comparison.
