After a high-ranking government official disappears in the Russell Square tube station, acerbic copper Pleasence investigates, only to find the last surviving decedent of a group of Victorian era tube workers that were believed dead after a cave-in. Pleasence is a lot of fun, and the cinematography and production values are far first-rate, but Sherman spends too much filler time following his grunting, howling cannibal as he mopes around following the loss of his only companion.

Parts of this film may be confusing for some, to alleviate this confusion, I offer the following FAQ:

Q: Why does the tube caveman have super strength?

A: The seemingly impossible strength exhibited by the tube caveman is a result of his high-protein diet. You too could drive a spade through a man's skull if your diet consisted solely of human flesh. That's basic science.

Q: Why does the tube caveman, who's incapable of coherent speech, wear clothes, including shoes and a blazer?

A: Though he is a primitive, devolved, man living in a cave, he's still a Londoner, and thus, like all Londoners, very dapper.

Q: What was Christopher Lee doing in this movie?

A: Apparently, during this time, Christopher Lee was contractually bound to appear in all British horror films. His two-minute cameo here fulfilled that obligation.
