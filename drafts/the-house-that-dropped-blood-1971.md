The House that Dripped Blood is an anthology film comprising four stories revolving around an old house in English countryside.

The first story follows Charles Hillyer, a writer moving into the house with his wife. Hillyer writes pulpy thrillers and feels the house’s old atmosphere will help him finish his latest novel. Sure enough, Hillyer cranks out the pages, losing himself in his work. Things take a turn for the macabre when he begins seeing his creation, the murderous strangler Dominic, in the flesh lurking around the estate. 

It’s a worn premise, but screenwriter Robert Bloch puts a twist on the twist that makes for a satisfying ending. 

The second story follows a retired businessman named Philip Grayson, played by Peter Cushing. Greyson becomes obsessed with a wax figure in a horrific museaum that bears a striking resemblence to a girl he once loved. 

Like the first installment, the premise is tired, but Cushing makes it work. Soon to be a widower in real life, Cushing brings a haunting pathos to what could be a throwaway role. 

The third story is by far the best of the bunch. Christopher Lee plays John Ried who moves into the house with his young daughter. Upon arrival the estate agent gives them a tour of the house including the fireplace. The girl runs crying from the fire. Reid is a widower, though the details surrounding his wife’s death are hazy. He hires a tutor, saying the girl must not go to school with other children. Astonished the girl has no toys of her own, the tutor buys the girl a few, including a small doll. Reid is outraged, and throws the doll into the fire. 

The mystery builds to a satisfying conclusion, with Lee playing on his type as a villian. 

The final story would have been better served with Lee starring as well. The story concerns an aging horror actor named Paul Henderson played by Jon Pertwee. Henderson is a blowhard who prefers the classics, like Dracula. The Lugosi one, not this new chap. Anyway, Henderson acquires a cape that once belonged to an actual vampire. When he puts it on, he becomes a vampire himself, complete with fangs, loss of reflection, and the ability to fly. While it’s nice seeing Ingrid Pitt, this entry beats a fast track for campland. Pertwee doesn’t seem comfortable witht the horror aspects, and I couldn’t buy him as a horror actor. 

Anthology films are always hard to grade. My rating represents an average of the individual segments, with the excellece of the third piece cancelling out the failed camp of the fourth. That said, the third peice is worth checking out, especially for fans of Lee. If the other stories don’t seem appealing, one can always make use of the fast-forward button.
