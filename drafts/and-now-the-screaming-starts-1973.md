And now the screaming starts tells a familar story. A young woman marries the man of her dreams. They return to his ancestral estate. Strange things begin to happen. She sees ghostly visions. Her husband seems to be keeping something from her. She digs for the truth, but everytime she gets close, someone ends up dead. 

In this respect, And now.. may not be original, but it does execute the formula well. Y is endearing as the young bride, and X is charming as her husband. The film gets a lot of atmosphere out of the sets, and a surprisingly good animated severed hand special effect. 

Soon, Y is pregnant. X begins to worry for her sanity, and calls in P, played by Peter Cushing. P is something of a non-believing Van Helsing with an attrocious wig. He’s tangiential to plot, and basically window dressing. Still, any Peter Cushing is welcome.

The film builds to a predictable conclusion. The big reveal at the end isn’t much of a schock, as we’ve long since guessed it. And that’s the film’s biggest problem. It overstays its welcome. Even at M minutes, it’s too long. The script mishandles the mystery of the curse, giving us no clues, and revealing everything in a single flashback. For a film like this to work it needs to give us something to go on early, even if its’ not the right thing. Something to keep the audience interested. The big reveal should be the finale, not precede it. 

Granted, the rain during the finale is a nice touch, but then again everything in the film looks great. It’s the execution that’s lacking. The ingredients were here for at least an okay film, but D just can’t pull them together.
