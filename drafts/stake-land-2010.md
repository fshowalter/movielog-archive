:pull_quote: _Stake Land_ may not be a revelation, but it is a solid entry in the post-apocalyptic horror genre.

In Stake Land the bad guys attack the good guys by dropping vampires out of helicopters.

Why are you still reading? Either that makes you want to see the movie, or there’s something wrong with you.

Okay, full disclosure, the bad guys only do that once.

The story is set in a near-future where vamps (a kind of fast-running-zombie/vampire hybrid) have overrun the world. 

But after an opening sequence where a vamp suck an infant dry then tosses aside the tiny corpse, the film keeps its creatures off-screen as much as possible until the super-bloody third act.

Instead, the film plays like a western road movie. Enigmatic loner Mister takes in orphaned teen Martin and the pair head out in Mister’s old Cadillac, searching for the fabled refuge of New Eden.

As they cross what’s left of the country, the scenery builds atmosphere. Deserted strip malls. Desolate two-lane blacktops. Overgrown buildings. Rusted scrapheaps. An urban wilderness. 

I enjoyed _Stake Land_, but it’s not perfect. The script leans on Martin’s voice-over narration. And I never quite bought co-writer Nick Damici as Mister. His eyes betray his grizzled facade. Warren Oates would have been perfect, were he forty years younger and not dead.

When Martin hears his family is “already dead,” he accepts it with wisdom seldom seen in horror films. That’s good. 

Still, the production values and supporting performances belie the film’s all but straight-to-video release.
