Quatermass-like scientist Jagger battles a radioactive blob in the Scottish countryside. The special effects are awful, of course, but not a deal-breaker as Gibbs' atmospheric cinematography helps belie the shoestring budget and Sangster's efficient script doesn't insult your intelligence provided you can get over the premise of a giant prehistoric radioactive ooze.
