_Inside Out_ is an ambitious animated feature. One I’m not sure of the target audience. The story follows a young girl named Riley.

But it is unique in that it follows Riley from the inside. Her mind, to be precise. We open just before she opens her eyes for the first time. We meet Joy, an anthromophologic representation of joy. Joy is a perky optimist and will serve as our protagonist for the film. In voicing her, Amy Pohler manages the near impossible task of being relentlessly perky and optimistic without ever being annoying. 

Shortly after Riley’s birth, the rest of her emotions appear. There’s Disgust, Fear, Anger and Sadness. Disgust, Fear, and Anger are basically comic relief, and the film struggles a bit early on as it tries to introduce Sadness. 

It’s not too much of a problem though, as soon the plot kicks in as Riley (now age 11)’s family moves to San Fransico. An already traumatic move is made worse by a dilapidated house, stressed out parents, a new school, and a moving van that seems to be cirumnavigating the globe en-route to San Francisco. 

Things get even worse when Joy and Sadness find themselves stranded outside of the control center, thus rendering Riley unable to feel either of their respective emotions.

From here, the film shifts to an andventure as Joy tries to get herself and Sandess back to headquarters. On the way they wander through Riley’s long-term memories and meet her almost-forgotten childhood imaginary friend. It’s an inspired deconstruction of the human psyche.

But the stakes become much higher as Riley, unable to feel anything but anger, fear and disgust begins lashing out at her parents and friends. The islands of her personality begin to crumble and fall away into the void. 

As Joy becomes more desparate to reach headquarters, the film introduces a scene of profound sadness. She finds herself in something of a dumping ground, where memories disolve into dust and are fogotten. We can see joyous images of Riley as a toddler, images of her with her imaginary friend. In this instant, the film cuts to the heart of the pain of growing up. Of the loss of childish innocence. I would be lying if I didn’t admit to getting a little choked up. Seriously, Bambi’s mom has nothing on this.

If this scene is a little disturbing to parents, then another will be equally so to children. In an effort to wake Riley up, Joy and Sadness induce a nightmare involving a giant clown that will likely give a fair number of young viewers nightmares of their own.

It’s an impressive film. The willingness to tackle complex themes without patronizing the audience is commendable. Odds are good you’ll find it a wonderful movie. I did. 

Well, almost. 

Here we come to the part of the review where I must issue spoiler warnings. I really did like this movie, but to talk about my problem with it, I must talk about the ending in great detail. Consider yourself warned.

Still here? Okay. About that ending.

It felt disengenous. For a film that felt so honest and true in it’s depection of the human condition, the ending felt too pat[^1].  For all the drama of the islands of personality crumbling into the void, a simple hug reconstructs them? We’re lead to believe everything is better than before, new memories are mixes of emotions instead of pure joy. Riley is back to her old self. Where were the consequences? There was a chance here to show Riley adjusting to the move, but at a cost. Maybe a part of her never comes back. Maybe the relationship with her parents is ever so sublty altered going forward. Anything but the saccarine, everything’s okay, bit of fluf we’re given. I mean, why imply that Riley’s dad moved the family out there to join a start-up? Given the time commitments that a start-up requires, and the failure rate amongst them, I thought they were setting up real family struggles. Maybe even a divorce. 

Now, I hear you. That’s way too dark for a Disney movie. But is it really? This is a movie that had already shown a willingness to frighten it’s younger audience, would showing Riley dealing with parental struggles really be that much more? Or, another way, would it be anything a good portion of the audience wasn’t already familiar with? 

I liked _Inside Out_, really, I did. If it hadn’t been so amazing, I wouldn’t have minded the ending. But I don’t think the film can have it both ways. It drives home the message that part of growing up is accepting a bit of sadness, but apparently that doesn’t extend to its own ending.

[^1] Yes, I realized I just used the phrase ‘the human condition’ in describing an animated film. It’s deserved.
