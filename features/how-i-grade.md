* ### a great movie ###
![5 stars](5-stars.svg) I loved it. A must-see. A perfect or nearly perfect movie. These are the movies I recommend to everyone. This is a hard rating to earn.

* ### a good movie ###
![4 stars](4-stars.svg) I really liked it. Unless you hate the genre or the star, you should watch it. These are the movies I recommend to most folks. They may not resonate like the 5-star selections, but they don't disappoint either. 

* ### an okay movie ###
![3 stars](3-stars.svg) I liked it. I wouldn't recommend it, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend _against_ it either. A good rule of thumb: If I liked it but can't remember a line of dialog one-week later, it was just okay. Many a summer blockbuster falls into this category. 

* ### a bad movie ###
![2 stars](2-stars.svg) I didn't like it. Unless you have a deep-seeded love for the genre or star, avoid this. Maybe it had a moment or two of goodness, but it was a disappointment. If I paid money to see it, I felt burned.

* ### an awful movie ###
![1 star](1-star.svg) I hated it. Not even in the “so-bad-it's-good” sense. Everyone involved should apologize. This too is a hard rating to earn. When reading a 1-star review, remember: I watch them so you don't have to.

## On Grading ##

Let's start with a binary scale. A yes or no. Gene Siskel based the famous 'Thumbs up/Thumbs down' system on the thought that a person just wants to know: “Should I see this movie?” [^1]  

It's a pragmatic approach, but how do you separate the good from the great? Put another way, both _Batman Begins_ and _The Dark Knight_ would get a "Thumbs up" but they are not equal.

Enter the star scale. I've seen scales with three stars all the way up to ten, sometimes with half-stars between. 

But not all star-systems are equal. 

Roger Ebert hated the four-star scale his paper used because it offered no middle ground.[^2] He's right, with no middle ground every movie must be either good or bad. Most movies are just okay. Thus, we can rule out the four-star system.

Next, let's consider the iMDb. It uses a ten-star system. That’s a lot of stars. In 2009 the median movie score was a 6.6. This implies that users are skewing toward the upper bounds. Defining the ratings could mitigate this, but that in itself is a challenge. If a 1-star rating means you hated it, and a 10-star rating means you loved it, what does a 3-star rating mean? 

So if four is too small and ten is too large, what's ideal?

I like the 5-star system. Ebert liked it too[^1]. It offers a middle ground (3-stars) while remaining small enough to allow for discreet rating definitions. 

And what about letter grade systems?[^3]. I quite like them. They're essentially a five-star system with an ‘A’ as 5-stars, a ‘B’ as 4-stars and so on. I use a letter grade system behind the scenes because it's how my brain works. 

So why display them as stars? Well, for one, grade definitions aren't universal. To me, a ’C’ grade means an “okay” movie, to others it means a bad movie. A 3-star out of 5 display makes it clear it's a middle-of-the-road rating.

The other reason is Netflix. With the service's rise in popularity, I decided to synchronize my grades with their review system. Thus, if you've rated movies on Netflix, my definitions will be familiar. 

Grading systems are harder than one would think. It's all about nuance. I think a 5-star system works, but I’m not married to the idea. Some of my favorite reviewers don’t rate at all. They’d rather you just read the review. Fair enough, but I bet they rate titles on Netflix.

[^2]: Ebert also argues that _readers_ dislike scales with a middle ground, but I disagree. We all know what it means for a movie to be just “okay.”
