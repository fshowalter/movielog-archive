:headline: Make LEGO-Shaped Gummy Candy With a DIY Silicone Mold
---
It’s fun to build things with LEGO, but it’s even more fun if you get to eat your custom creations. These homemade LEGO gummy candies are easy to make, taste great, and can even be stacked like real LEGO bricks.

In this video, youtuber Grant Thompson “The King of Random” explains what you need to make custom gummy candies, and how to do it. For ingredients, you’ll need a box of your favorite flavor of Jell-O, corn syrup, and a few packets of unflavored gelatin. You’ll also need some food grade molding silicone to make the LEGO mold (this video will show you to create the mold). When you have your mold ready, mix a half cup of very cold water with a quarter cup of corn syrup and stir it together until the liquid turns clear. Pour the liquid into a pot with the Jell-O and packets of gelatin, stir it until everything mixes in evenly, and heat it on the stove at medium-low heat for 5 to 10 minutes. Your sugary soup should now be a thick candy syrup that’s ready to be poured into your mold. Let the gelatin cool for about five hours on your counter and you have your own homemade, LEGO-shaped gummy candy.
