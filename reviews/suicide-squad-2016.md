You'd think an ancient demon threatening armageddon would be hard to forget, but _Suicide Squad_ proves otherwise.

The plot concerns a shadowy government operative who assembles a group of super-villains to form a super-powered Delta Force. Will Smith plays Deadshot, an assassin who never misses. Margot Robbie plays Harley Quinn, a former psychiatrist whose super-power is finding the Joker attractive. Viola Davis plays Amanda Waller, the puppet-master who sells the project to the Washington brass. The rest of the cast fall somewhere between underwritten and forgettable.

The team lacks edge. Deadshot won't kill women or children. Harley's just a brat in love with a psycho. You get the sense earlier drafts had more bite. That studio notes citing merchandise and demographic appeal chipped away at the script. The toothless result plays less like _The Dirty Dozen (1976)_ and more like _The Bad News Bears (1976)_.

The only characters packing genuine menace are Waller and The Joker, neither of whom is on the team.

The Joker is hardly in the film. Jared Leto mashes up Heath Ledger's intensity in _The Dark Knight (2008)_ with Jack Nicholson's flamboyant camp in _Batman (1989)_. The resulting performance commands your attention, as would a train wreck.

There's also a Batman cameo, but that too disappoints. In _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)_, Batman erupted from the shadows and disabled thugs with brutal efficiency. Here, he floats down well-lit side streets and taps super-villains on the shoulder.

Back to _Suicide Squad_.

The film struggled to hold my interest. There's a scene eighty-some-minutes in where the squad rescues Amanda Waller. I thought the movie over. But I'd forgotten the film's antagonists, a pair of supernatural entities bent on world destruction. Or some-such. Instead of the end-credits, I had to sit through forty more minutes of predictable plot points and bad CGI.

I remember it was bad, but in truth, I'd forgotten most of it by the following morning. That's _Suicide Squad_ in a nutshell.
