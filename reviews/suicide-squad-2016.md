You'd think an ancient demon threatening armageddon would be hard to forget, but Suicide Squad proves otherwise.

The plot concerns a group of incarcerated super-villains brought together to form a super-powered Delta Force. Will Smith plays Deadshot, an assassin who never misses. Margot Robbie plays Harley Quinn, a former psychiatrist whose super-power is finding the Joker attractive. Viola Davis plays Amanda Waller, the puppet-master who sells the project to the Washington brass. The rest of the cast fall somewhere between underwritten and forgettable.

The team lacks edge. Deadshot won't kill women or children. Harley's just a brat in love with a psycho. The Dirty Dozen (1976), this ain't.

The only characters packing genuine menace are Waller and The Joker, neither of whom is on the team.

The Joker is hardly in the film. Jared Leto mashes up Heath Ledger's intensity in The Dark Knight (2008) with Jack Nicholson's flamboyant camp in Batman (1989). The resulting performance commands your attention; as would a train wreck.

Even the Batman cameo disappoints. In Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), Batman erupted from the shadows to cripple thugs with brutal efficiency. Here, he floats down well-lit side streets and taps super-villains on the shoulder.

Back to Suicide Squad.

The film struggled to hold my interest. There's a scene eighty-some-minutes in where the squad rescues Waller. I thought the movie over. But I'd forgotten the film's antagonists, a pair of supernatural entities bent on world destruction or some-such. Instead of the end-credits, I had to sit through forty more minutes of predictable plot points and bad CGI, most of which Iâ€™d forgotten by the following morning.

That's Suicide Squad in a nutshell.
