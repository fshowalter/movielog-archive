Despite its title, _The Boogie Man Will Get You_ is not a horror movie. It’s a dark comedy in the vein of _Arsenic and Old Lace (1944)_.

Boris Karloff plays Nathaniel Billings, an eccentric but earnest old professor. Billings spends his days working in the basement laboratory of his crumbling tavern home.

Along comes Winnie, a young divorcee who wants to buy Billings’ house and turn it into an inn. Billings agrees to sell, provided he can stay on and complete his experiments.

Of course, Winnie doesn’t know that Billings is trying to create an army of atomic supermen to win World War II. Or that his test subjects comprise the assorted traveling salesmen that chance upon his door. Or that his experiments have all been fatal failures, leaving him with a room full of well-preserved corpses.

One would expect this sort of thing to come to light during the walk-through, but the film gives Winnie the mental acuity of a toddler.

Peter Lorre plays Arthur Lorencz, a smarmy opportunist who’s the town doctor. He’s also the mayor, mortician, notary, and everything else. He even holds the mortgage on Billings’ home.

The two pair-up after Lorencz, in his capacity as town sheriff, confronts Billings about one of the corpses. With idyllic pride, Billings explains his experiments. Lorencz sees dollar signs. Never mind the dead body, Billings’ experiments could be worth a fortune! Soon they’re partners bemoaning the lack of quality “test subjects”. It’s a terrific bit.

But rather than continue with low-key, edgy material that, the script degenerates into an outright farce. The finale sees the cast held hostage by an escaped fascist seeking to blow up a nearby munitions depot. Because, of course, it makes perfect sense to open an inn next to a munitions depot. Karloff and Lorre do their best, but _The Boogie Man Will Get You_ wastes their potential.
