Shock Waves tells the story of a group of tourists who wind up stranded on a remote island. There, they fall prey to a troop of undead, water-breathing Nazis.

For a horror film, that’s a solid plot. Yet, watching Shock Waves is an exercise in frustration.

The film starts well enough. John Carradine is fun as the salty tourist boat skipper. He holds our interest while the script goes about stranding the characters on the island. Unfortunately, the script achieves this via an awkward series of contrived occurrences. The worst of which sees Carradine throw the ship’s navigation system overboard.

Once on the island, things again look promising. The Florida location photography looks great, and the filmmakers struck gold shooting in an abandoned Biltmore hotel. The decrepit luxury oozes atmosphere. But soon enough, the script resumes treating its characters as puppets instead of people.

Upon arriving at the seemingly deserted hotel, the group discovers an aquarium teaming with exotic fish. No one thinks to ask who feeds them. The answer is Peter Cushing. Cushing plays a morose Nazi living in self-imposed exile to watch over his undead charge. He warns the group to get off the island immediately, even telling them where they can find a boat. Do they listen? Of course not. Both Cushing and Carradine have roles so minor they’re window dressing, but they’re the best parts of the film.

Soon the Nazi zombies start picking off group members. They get a lot of help from the script. A veteran sailor impales his foot on a sea urchin after tromping barefoot through a murky inland stream. Later, five grown men and women manage to lose a sailboat, their only chance at escape, in knee-deep water.

What follows was my breaking point. It’s night. Nazi zombies crawl the island, killing anyone they find. The surviving passengers decide to barricade themselves inside the hotel fridge until morning. It’s a solid plan, as the zombies are adverse to light, and the fridge is built like a vault. Having written itself into a corner, the script takes a heavy hand. Suddenly, a passenger is claustrophobic. But that’s not enough, as the script needs all the characters out of the fridge. The claustrophobic passenger flips out, firing a flare into the fridge, filling it with smoke and blinding one of the passengers.

A horror film such as this must do one of two things: engender the characters to us, so we root for them to survive, or dispatch the characters in creatively gruesome manners. Shock Waves gives us the worst of both worlds. We don’t just fail to like these characters, by the end, we’re actively rooting against most of them. We want to see their foolish behavior punished. It’s part of the vicarious thrill of horror movies. When claustrophobia guy decides to jeopardize the lives of everyone rather than quietly sneak away, we expect to see him offed in spectacular fashion. When his demise consists of a zombie pulling him underwater (the same as the victim before him), it’s unfulfilling.

That the final girl makes it out alive is something of a miracle. That’s not a spoiler. The film opens with her rescue, and the rest is a flashback. Yet, at the film’s end, she’s revealed to be an unreliable narrator. Meaning the entire film could be a figment of her imagination. If so, her imagination is an awful screenwriter.
