_For the Defense_ stars William Powell as Bill Foster. Bill is a slick defense lawyer famous for using any technicality or loophole to get his clients an acquittal, despite their obvious guilt. He’s so well-respected in the underworld that, when his car’s stolen, the crooks return it after getting a look at the registration.

Bill’s seeing a showgirl, Irene, played by Kay Francis. Irene wants Bill to marry her, but Bill says he's not the marrying kind. Irene's also seeing another guy, Jack, behind Bill's back. Jack’s a nice-enough guy, but he lacks Bill’s swagger. Jack wants to marry Irene, but Irene just strings him along,  hoping Bill will change his mind.

Early one morning, Irene’s driving Jack home. They've been out all night and Jack’s pie-eyed drunk. Jack gropes at her, causing her to hit and kill a stranded motorist. Recognizing what it would do to her reputation, were she discovered out with him at the early hour, Jack insists she flee the scene. Jack stays and takes the rap for the death.

Irene persuades Bill to take Jacks’s case. But as the evidence comes to light, Bill realizes Irene was out with Jack. Things look bad for Jack. Soon, Bill realizes he’ll have to chose between Irene’s reputation and Jack’s liberty. Irene wants to take the stand to exonerate Jack, but Bill won’t let her ruin her reputation. There’s another option, but it means crossing a line Bill vowed he would never cross.

As melodramas go, _For the Defense_ isn’t a bad one. Early on, when Bill’s riding high, his urbane charm, affinity for alcohol[^1], and underworld connections foreshadow Powell’s famous turn as Nick Charles in the _Thin Man_ series of films. Francis plays well opposite him and doesn’t overact her part.

But the film sees both of them delivering lines and, mid-sentence, turning to gaze at nothing in particular for dramatic effect. It’s an annoying affectation that mars an otherwise passable hour and five minutes.
