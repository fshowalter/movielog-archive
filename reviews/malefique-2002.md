_Maléfique_ falls short of its potential.

The film opens with a man saying goodbye to his wife and young son. The man’s name is Carrère. He is a white-collar criminal and today marks his first day in prison. We meet his cellmates: Lassalle, an older librarian who says little, Marcus, a brash young man whose large breast implants clash with his brawny physique, and Pâquerette, a man-child with a penchant for eating things.

After establishing these characters and their interpersonal dynamics, the plot kicks into gear. The men discover an old diary that doubles as a spell book. Eager to escape, the men try some incantations but discover magic carries a high cost.

I relished this premise. Taking four desperate (but not fierce) men and dangling a supernatural means of escape overflows with potential.

Carrère and Lassalle are well-cast. As Carrère, Gérald Laroche provides a grounded audience surrogate whose gradual transformation into a bitter convict carries the film. As Lassalle, Philippe Laudenbach adds gravitas, communicating volumes with his weary looks.

I was fine with Clovis Cornillac as Marcus, but his character felt underwritten—his transgenderedness regulated to a plot device. As Pâquerette, Dimitri Rataud’s performance felt artificial. I kept hoping the film would reveal Pâquerette as a calculating mastermind masquerading as an imbecile, but no.

Instead, the story devolves into a predictable version of [_The Monkey’s Paw_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey's_Paw). What begins like Lovecraft ends like an episode of _Tales from the Crypt_.

Imagine a film that took these characters—one imprisoned in his body, one in his mind, one in his wealth—and explored their prisons and the lengths they would go for freedom. _Maléfique_ is not that movie. It’s not a bad film, just a disappointing one.
