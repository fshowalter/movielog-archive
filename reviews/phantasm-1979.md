I was still watching Saturday morning cartoons and struggling with cursive writing when I first saw _Phantasm_. It scared the crap out of me.

The story concerns a kid not much older than my young self. One who'd put away his toys but hadn't yet discovered girls. His parents died a few months earlier in a car crash. Now, he follows his older brother everywhere. In the process, he uncovers some strange goings-on at the local mortuary.

I won’t reveal any more, as much of the film's joy comes from the unexpected way writer-director Don Coscarelli runs with this setup. It’s executed from a child's point of view and plays like a nightmare. We sense we’re missing something. In a lesser film these gaps would feel like plot holes. Here, they add to the film’s unrelenting sense of unease.

Though it’s often lumped in with the slasher pictures that dominated early 80s horror, _Phantasm_ stands apart. It’s equal parts science fiction and dark fantasy. Take out the brief nudity and ironic steel ball, and you'd have a PG-13 film.

But about that ball. Those with squeamish stomaches may find it rough. As a special effect, it’s a collision of imagination,  exploitation, and blood. Lots of blood. To my younger self, it was mortifying.

Along with the stark white interior sets, that ball pushed my younger self over the edge. I had nightmares for weeks. Not bad for a movie made by a 27-year-old director on a $300,000 budget.

_Phantasm_ is a triumph of production design. So much of the film, including Angus Grimm himself, looks unsettling. It sounds unsettling too. Coscarelli steals liberally from the likes of Argento and Fulci, creating an ominous, disconcerting score that adds to the film's impact.

Watching it now, _Phantasm_ plays like a remake of the film I saw as a child. Scenes tug at memories of a more brutal experience. One that traumatized me, carving itself into my malleable psyche, sewing the seeds of my predilection for nihilistic, nightmare-like horror. _Phantasm_ may not be perfect, but it made lasting impression.
