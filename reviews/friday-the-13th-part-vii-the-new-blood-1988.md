There’s a lesson here. I came to _Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood_ with an open mind. Sure, I’d heard rumblings it was bad, but I’d seen enough “bad” films to know the masses can be wrong.

The story opens at night with seven-year-old Tina standing outside a house on Crystal Lake. Inside, we hear her parents fighting. Mom’s yelling at Dad, saying he promised he wouldn’t drink so much. Dad’s smacking Mom and telling her to shut up. It aims for drama but plays as caricature.

Tina runs down to the lake, walks down a short pier, and gets into a small fishing boat. She motors out to the middle of the lake. Dad comes running out of the house[^1]. He yells for her to come back. Mom comes out and joins in the yelling. Dad advances down the pier.

Tina gives Dad the stink-eye of death and the pier starts shaking. Not a rumble, but a full-on cartoonish wobble. With the pylons jutting several feet into the air, it resembles a carnival ride gone haywire.

The pier crumbles into the lake, taking Dad with it.

We flash-forward[^2]. Seventeen-year-old Tina is returning to Crystal Lake along with her mother, at the coaxing of her smarmy psychiatrist, Dr. Crews. The good doctor insists Tina confront her father’s death by revisiting the scene.

Tina and her mother arrive at the lake house. They find Dr. Crews waiting. Next door is an obligatory house full of teens. 

A few needless scenes later, Tina’s telekinesis reanimates Jason[^3], who sets to work massacring the teens next door[^4].

Meanwhile, Tina’s mom uncovers Dr. Crews’ true intentions. There’s a lot of over-emoting and dues ex machina that culminates in Tina using her telekinetic powers to hurl flower pots at Jason.

Okay, so the masses were right. This is an awful movie. Sitting through it was a chore. Like the song says: _Sometimes, bad is bad_. Lesson learned.

But it should have been better. The script borrows its setup from the franchise’s best entry, _Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)_. And Kane Hodder transforms Jason into a hulking monster with ample screen presence.

But the script tacks on a mill stone sub-plot involving telekinetic Tina, her mother, and Dr. Crews that sinks the movie. 

More than once, I ached to fast-forward through these scenes. They aren’t just bad. They’re screaming baby on an airplane bad. Painful for everyone involved.

I don’t fault the performers, the script does them no favors. Consider Tina. She’s an ineffectual protagonist who spends most of the film in histrionics. The worst kind of [final girl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_girl). When the other teens take an instant dislike to her, we’re on their side. And speaking of those teens, they’re just fodder. None of them register as individuals and they have no chemistry together.

Worst of all, the film takes itself far too seriously. The black humor of _Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986)_ is gone. So is the manic campiness of _Friday the 13th: A New Beginning (1985)_. Instead, we suffer through scenes alternating between idle boredom and overwrought melodrama. When Jason offs a character, it’s a relief. Not because it breaks some nonexistent tension, but because we’re one step closer to the film’s end. In _Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood_, it’s the audience, not Jason’s quarry, that suffers.

[^1]: My first thought upon seeing Dad: _[Stewart Smalley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart\_Smalley)?_

[^2]: Setting this entry in the then-future of 2001. I wonder how many fans realized this back in 1988.

[^3]: Jason ended the prior film chained to the bottom of Crystal Lake. The script doesn’t try to explain how Tina’s telekinesis revives him. In his [review on Horror Movie A Day](http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com/2009/01/friday-13th-part-vii-new-blood.html), Brian Collins speculates the telekinesis aspect was a response to the higher grossing A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. 

[^4]: The movie should end here. Tina resurrects Jason and passes out. Jason dismembers her unconscious body. But no. Jason marches past her _and_ both houses. He goes a few miles up a dark road to off a pair of teens before circling back to continue his rampage.
