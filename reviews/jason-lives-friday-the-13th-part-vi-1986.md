Jason lives. Not _Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives_ but _Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI_. After the head-scratching mess that was _Friday the 13th: A New Beginning (1985)_, somebody in Paramount’s marketing division must have worried that kids would stop reading after the _Friday the 13th_ part of the title. I’m not sure things were that dire, but it does give you a sense of this film’s mandate.

This entry more or less ignores the last film’s events. It opens with Tommy Jarvis determined to rid himself of the specter of Jason. To that end, he plans to dig up Jason’s corpse and incinerate it. He's even brought a buddy along for help[^1].

Tommy and his friend dig up the corpse all right, but a bolt of lightening reanimates the maggot-filled carcass. Undead Jason makes short work of Tommy's pal, but Tommy manages to escape and attempts to warn the local sheriff. The sheriff, of course, doesn't believe Tommy and runs him out of town.

Meanwhile, Jason resumes his murderous ways. He offs some corporate paintballers, and a few teen camp counselors before Tommy gets back to town. Thinking Tommy committed the murders himself, the sheriff locks Tommy up.

Not to worry though, the sheriff’s plucky teen daughter frees Tommy from his cell. Using a plan Tommy gleaned from reading a book on the occult, the two head to Camp Crystal Lake to stop Jason.

This entry cements Jason’s transition from deranged madman to supernatural monster. Jason now has super human strength. Bullets can't kill him. Early on, Tommy looks to incinerate Jason, but the skies open up and the resulting rain prevents Tommy from striking a match. It’s a nice nod that casts Jason as something of a force of nature.

This installment also sports a nice streak of self-referential black comedy. Consider the scene where Jason stalks a group of children. One of the boys looks at another and asks sarcastically: “So, what _did_ you want to be when you grew up?”

Indeed, when ever Jason's on screen this entry's a lot of fun. Unfortunately, the plot revolves around Tommy. A better script would have killed him off in the film's opening sequence. Instead, we suffer through a tired "boy who cried wolf" plot that never pays off, and cringe at the stilted melodrama with the sheriff’s daughter.  A stronger performer might have been able to rise above the material. But Thom Mathews’ performance as Tommy kept reminding me of Michael Dudikoff in _American Ninja (1985)_. Minus the ninja bad-assery.

The focus on Tommy comes at the expense of the supporting cast. Almost all of  Jason's victim fail to register. The female camp counselors in particular felt interchangeable. They exist only as fodder for Jason and thus, when Jason’s not on screen, they’re boring. 

_Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI_ isn’t an awful movie. The depiction of Jason is great, and the fourth-wall humor is a nice touch. But the forced melodrama and bland supporting cast drag things down. The only character we’re interested in is Jason and when he’s off screen, this entry is a snooze.
