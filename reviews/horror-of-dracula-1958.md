Howard Hawks once said that a good movie consisted of  "three great scenes and no bad ones." Hammer's first entry in its _Dracula_ franchise gives us exactly that.

The first great scene comes early. Jonathan Harker has arrived at Castle Dracula posing as a librarian.  While prowling the castle's corridors at night, he finds a young woman. She sports ruby red lips, brilliant blue eyes and ample cleavage. She is terrified. She claims she’s being held prisoner. She begs Harker to help her escape. Harker feigns ignorance. She persists. His resolve weakens. He agrees to help her. Grateful, she bursts into tears and buries her head in his shoulder. The music shifts. We see her blue eyes fix on Harker’s neck. Her head tilts back as her eyes close. Her ruby red lips draw back to reveal fangs. She bites Harker.

Just as she does, Dracula (Christopher Lee) bursts into the room with a piercing shriek. Lee is feral and demonic. Shown in close up, His eyes are bloodshot red. His gore-smeared sneer reveals blood-covered fangs. The shot lasts all of a few seconds, but it still packs a punch. This is Dracula in all his visceral glory.

The second great scene happens at about the three-quarters mark. Dracula has turned Harker's fiancee Lucy who's now preying on children. Lucy's brother Arthur has gone to her crypt at night, to assure himself that she’s not a vampire. To Arthur’s horror, he finds Lucy returning to her tomb, leading a young girl. Lucy's eyes light up with more than just brotherly love. “Come, let me kiss you,” she says to Arthur. She advances, baring her fangs, but Arthur stands transfixed.

Before she can consummate the act, Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) appears and thrusts a crucifix into her face. She backs away in agony. Van Helsing, jaw set, eyes full of cold detachment, advances. She's cornered. Van Helsing presses the crucifix to her forehead. The flesh smolders and burns, leaving the imprint of the cross. Van Helsing stares down, unmoved. Lucy shrieks and flees into her tomb.

It's a crackerjack scene that works just as well today as it did half a century ago. The practical effects still look great and Cushing's performance in the scene is perfect.

The third great scene is the finale. Arthur and Van Helsing have chased Dracula back to his castle. Dawn is fast approaching. Van Helsing catches the count before he can disappear down a secret passage. The two grapple. The count looks to have the upper hand until Van Helsing vaults atop a long table, runs the length and launches himself into the air, grabbing the wall's tapestry curtains as he lands, pulling them down to let in the morning sun. Dracula tries to flee, but Van Helsing pins him in place by fashioning a make-shift crucifix out of candle holders.

The swashbuckling acrobatics cement Van Helsing  as the heroic foil to the villainous Count. Cushing's Van Helsing isn't just a wise man with a strong will, he's a man of action. The iconic monster hunter out to rid the world of supernatural evil.

I vacillate between this film and _Dracula (1931)_ for my favorite interpretation of the Count. I prefer Lee’s grittier performance, but I dislike the overt physicality. His Dracula runs, grapples, and digs holes[^1]. It makes for more action on screen, but it also lends the character a vulnerability that softens his edge. Also, Lee doesn't have any dialog apart from his introductory scene, which is a shame. A battle of wills scene between Cushing and Lee would have been dynamite[^2]. Consider how the classic line, "You are very wise for one who has lived but a single lifetime,” would sound in Lee’s ominous baritone.

Still, _Dracula_ (_Horror of Dracula_ here in the US) is a great film. Buoyed by two iconic leads in Cushing and Lee, it rolls along at a terrific pace.  By paring down the supporting cast and playing up the sex and gore, it makes the familiar plot feel fresh and new. It turns a gothic horror story into a thrilling adventure. Hawks' definition of a great movie may be a bit simplistic, but _Dracula_ is proof that simple can work.

[^1]: The hole-digging scene always throws me. Why wouldn’t he put her in the crypt? And how does he happen to have a shovel handy?

[^2]: It’s a shame that Lee and Cushing wouldn’t meet again as Dracula and Van Helsing until the disappointing _Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972)_. Cushing starred in the immediate sequel _The Brides of Dracula (1960)_ which lacked Lee. Lee returned in the third installment _Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966)_ which lacked Cushing.
