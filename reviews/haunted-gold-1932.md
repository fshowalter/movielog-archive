_Haunted Gold_ is a no-budget, shot-in-a-week remake of _The Phantom City (1928)_ that recycles footage from the original. Even by those standards, it's awful.

The plot sees a young John Wayne playing a cowboy investigating a haunted mine.

Later in his career, Wayne could carry a movie by himself, but in 1932, he needed help.

In Wayne's B-westerns from Lone Star, help often came in the form of stuntman Yakima Canutt and veteran character actor Gabby Hayes. Canutt's stunt work injected legitimate thrills into the wooden narratives. Hayes's easy demeanor smoothed over young Wayne's work-in-progress delivery.

This entry, from Warner Brothers, offers no such help. Though the sets and camera work represent a step up from the Lone Star productions, they're no substitute for Canutt and Hayes.

Instead of Canutt's stunt work, we get flat, recycled action footage and lots of exposition. Talky scenes involving half-shares in mines, frame-ups, betrayals, and a mysterious Phantom.

Instead of Hayes, we get Blue Washington as Wayne's sidekick. It's an unfunny and demeaning role that sees him referred to as "boy" by Wayne and "watermelon mouth" by the villains. Washington appeared in films for twenty-five more years, but this was his final on-screen credit. What a shame.

Between the overt racism, spliced footage, and tedious plot, even the most ardent John Wayne fans will struggle to enjoy _Haunted Gold_.
