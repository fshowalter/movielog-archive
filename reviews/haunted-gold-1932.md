I like John Wayne, but I struggled with _Haunted Gold_.

Wayne plays a cowboy investigating an abandoned mine. It's a dull, talky story involving half-shares in mines, frame-ups, betrayals, and a mysterious Phantom.

Turns out, it's a remake of _The Phantom City (1928)_ and even recycles some of that picture's footage. In true B-movie fashion, those shots use a different film stock.

As for Wayne, his performance is stiff and unsure, miles from his signature laconic persona.  At twenty-five, he was still learning.

And then there's Blue Washington as Wayne's sidekick. It's an unfunny and demeaning role that sees him referred to as "boy" by Wayne and "watermelon mouth" by the villains. It makes a bad movie even worse.
