_Blue Ruin_ is a near-perfect rural neo-noir.

Macon Blair stars as Dwight. As the film opens, he's easing into a warm bath inside a cozy single-family home on the Delaware coast. Just as he relaxes, the owners arrive and Dwight hurries out of the house. It's an elegant metaphor because, as we'll learn, Dwight has been running for much of his adult life.

One morning, the local police rouse Dwight in the rusty car he calls home and take him to the police station. The officers call him by name and treat him with kindness. He's not in trouble, they just want him in a safe place when he hears the news: the man who murdered Dwight's parents has received an early parole.

Dwight listens with a wordless, eerie calm. He returns to his car, replaces the battery, fills up the tank, and heads home to Virginia.

Dwight arrives in time to watch his parents' killer, Wade Cleland Jr., walk free. As the raucous Cleland clan collect Wade in a white limousine, Dwight's expression mirrors the mix of bile and nausea churning in his gut.

Dwight tails the limo to a nearby dive bar. He slips in unnoticed and waits in the restroom. His wide eyes dart around. He wanted a gun, but could only afford the small shiv in his sweaty hand.

Soon, Wade enters the restroom and Dwight exacts his revenge. It's a brutal, clumsy bit of violence that leaves Dwight blood-soaked and shaken. Dwight sneaks out of the bar and slashes the limo's tire, gashing his hand in the process. Dwight returns to his car and reaches for his keys, but they're gone. He lost them during the fight.

In a lesser film, this would seem predictable and forced. Here, it feels natural, almost inescapable. Dwight steals the limo and escapes, knowing the police will trace his abandoned car. There are no clean getaways.

With nowhere to go, Dwight turns to his estranged sister. After their parents' death, Dwight disappeared. His sister grieved and moved on. She's raising two small children who've never met their uncle.

As they talk, Dwight keeps one eye on the local TV news. He soon realizes with horror that the Clelands haven't reported the murder. Meaning they intend to exact their own revenge. Knowing the Clelands will track his car back to his sister, Dwight convinces her to leave town with her family. Once she's safe, Dwight awaits the inevitable.

_Blue Ruin_ unwinds in a simple, straightforward manner. No flashbacks or quirky characters. No pop-culture references. No explosions or car chases. Just a solid story told well.

Well, almost. Fair warning, I'm about to nitpick an otherwise great film. Consider it tough love.

My first problem lies with a single line. It comes when a friend of Dwight's says he does a lot of target shooting. If you've seen the film, you know this line telegraphs what should have been a surprising plot point. For a film that's so judicious with its dialog, it's a glaring blemish.

Yes, it's one line. I told you I'm nitpicking. That said, the next issue proves more substantial, as it goes to the heart of the story.

We're told Dwight's parents were murdered because Dwight's father had an affair with Wade Cleland Jr.'s mother. During the movie, this seems plausible, but in retrospect, it falls apart. The Cleland clan keep a machine gun duct-taped under their easy chair and delight in the thought of murdering Dwight's sister and her children. How does Dwight's father hook up with a woman who raised such gun-crazy, foaming-at-the-mouth psychos? The characters tell us it happened, but the movie offers nothing to support it.

These bits only stand out because the rest of the film rings so true. _Blue Ruin_ may not be perfect, but it's damn close.
