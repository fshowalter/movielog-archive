In _Ride Him, Cowboy_, the town gathers to put a horse on trial. This may not be the film's most ridiculous moment.

The story concerns The Hawk, a mysterious outlaw who's been terrorizing the local community. No one's seen his face and lived. Enter a wandering cowboy, played by John Wayne, who tries to apprehend The Hawk, only to end up framed for the outlaw's crimes.

The opening sequence reveals The Hawk's identity, so there's no mystery. It also telegraphs the finale by leaving someone alive, albeit in a coma, who can identify The Hawk. Again, said person is in a coma but, as the doctor says “He's been unconscious for 3-days. I don't know when he'll comeout of it, but he'll be fine.”

The absurdity continues to the aforementioned horse trial, through Wayne's introduction, and to his framing. This consists of The Hawk dropping Wayne's monogrammed harmonica at a raid site. That's all the town needs to lynch Wayne. As they say, “We've got incontrovertible proof.”

And yet, despite the inanity, or perhaps because of it, the female lead surprises. When surrounded by The Hawk's gang, she doesn't wind up captured and used as a plot device to motivate Wayne's inevitable rescue. Instead, she displays surprising wit and actually rescues Wayne. It's only later that she winds up captured and used as a plot device to motivate Wayne's inevitable rescue.

As for Wayne, he's still rough around the edges. But you can glimpse his burgeoning talent in his comedic reaction shots during his sham trial.

_Ride Him, Cowboy_ may be forgettable nonsense, but it never aspires to anything more. At best, it's a curio—a glimpse into the journey John Wayne took to become John Wayne.
