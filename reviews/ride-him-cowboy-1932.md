In _Ride Him, Cowboy_, a town puts a horse on trial for attempted murder. This may not be the film's most ridiculous scene.

The story concerns The Hawk, a mysterious outlaw terrorizing the local community. Enter a wandering cowboy, played by John Wayne, who tries to apprehend The Hawk, only to end up framed for the outlaw's crimes.

The opening sequence reveals The Hawk's identity, so there's no mystery. It also telegraphs the finale by introducing someone who can identify The Hawk. Granted, said person lies comatose but, as the doctor says, “I don't know when he'll come out of it, but he'll be fine.”

This absurdity continues to the aforementioned horse trial, through Wayne's introduction, and to his framing. This consists of The Hawk dropping Wayne's monogrammed harmonica after raiding a homestead. That's all the town needs to lynch Wayne. As they say, “We've got incontrovertible proof.”

And yet, despite the inanity, or perhaps because of it, the script surprises. When the female lead finds herself surrounded by The Hawk's gang, she isn’t captured. Instead, she displays surprising wit and actually rescues Wayne. It's only _later_ that she’s captured.

As for Wayne, he's still learning. You catch glimpses of his iconic persona, such as his reaction shots during his sham trial, but they're rare.

_Ride Him, Cowboy_ may be forgettable nonsense, but it never aspires to anything more. At best, it's a curio—a glimpse into the journey John Wayne took to become John Wayne.
