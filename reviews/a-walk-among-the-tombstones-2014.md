_A Walk Among the Tombstones_ is predictable and condescending. Watching it left me angry.

Liam Neeson plays Matthew Scudder, a recovering alcoholic and ex-cop. Scudder quit the force after gunning down some street toughs who tried robbing his neighborhood bar. His superiors called him a hero and gave him a commendation. Scudder quit anyway. He quit drinking too. Later, we learn his actions weren’t quite so heroic. It’s meant to shock us, but we see it coming.

Scudder makes his living as an unlicensed private investigator. He goes to work for a drug trafficker who’s wife was kidnapped, raped, tortured, and killed. The trail leads Scudder to a pair of horrific sociopaths who’ve been preying on young women for a long time.

We see Scudder work the case even as the killers stalk their next target. It’s dark, gritty, creepy and full of potential. But rather than focus on the investigation, the script doubles down on cop-movie tropes.

Scudder acquires a sidekick in the form of a plucky, street-smart homeless boy named TJ. TJ has sickle-cell anemia; a plot point designed to engender audience sympathy and facilitate an improbable third act. Will TJ break through Scudder’s tough exterior? I think you know the answer. 

The film’s contempt for its audience’s intelligence is galling. Scudder verbalizes every clue, even when it makes no sense for him to do so. At one point, Scudder discovers some badly written romance fiction. He reads it aloud even though he’s alone and the camera is on the page. Here is a film that doesn’t even trust us to read.

Spoon-feeding plot-points like this results in many redundant scenes. The movie opens with one. Scudder sits in a car with his partner. The partner bemoans Scudder’s drinking, saying he worries he can’t count on Scudder to have his back. Scudder gets out of the car and walks into a bar. It’s morning. He grabs a paper and sits down. Without a word, the bartender brings Scudder a coffee and two shots of whiskey.

Why not just open with Scudder walking into the bar? The morning light, the lack of dialog, the coffee and shots; they tell us everything we need to know. And we never see that partner again.

I wanted to like this movie. Really, I did. I love a good detective story, and the film name-checks Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe. But it follows that with a joke based on a dated football reference that wouldn’t be funny even if it were current.

A few minutes on Wikipedia tells me that _A Walk Among the Tombstones_ combines several novels by Lawrence Block. Maybe the film tried to condense too many sub-plots into a single movie, or maybe the books were just bad. Either way, it’s pretty damning that Liam Neeson’s would-be New York accent is the least of this film’s problems.
