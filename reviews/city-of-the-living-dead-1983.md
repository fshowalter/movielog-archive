In a desolate church cemetery, Father Thomas hangs himself from an old oak tree. Medium Mary Woodhouse (MacColl) sees the act during a seance, convulses violently and drops dead from shock. Nosing for a story, reporter Peter Bell (George) attends Mary’s funeral. As the mourners trickle away, Peter lingers and Mary awakens in her coffin, very much alive and frantic to escape. Peter hears her scratching at the coffin lid–or likely thinks he does, thanks to Mary’s psychic talents–and frees her. Mary tells Peter about her vision, and how Thomas’s suicide was a sacrifice intended to open the gates of Hell. Peter is skeptical but curious, and agrees to travel with Mary to where she believes the gate to exist, a remote New England town called Dunwich. In Dunwich, people are starting to disappear thanks to the now undead Thomas, who claims a pair of teens in a horrific–albeit memorable–sequence. Peter and Mary arrive and eventually connect with the few locals with enough sense and luck to stay alive. Together, they head for the cemetery in a last-ditch effort to close the gate and avoid the apocalypse.

Fulci’s film, the first of his unofficial Gates of Hell trilogy (followed by The Beyond (1981) and The House by the Cemetery (1981)) is a blend of mystery and horror with MacColl and George trying to track down the source of her vision while Fabrizio Jovine’s Father Thomas racks up the victims in increasingly gory ways. The supernatural aspects of the plot defy logical explanation, with Jovine appearing and disappearing at will. It’s not a matter of lazy screenwriting, but a calculated measure to show the characters battling forces they can’t possibly understand. The resulting chaos only adds to the gut-wrenching sense of dread that Fulci cultivates throughout the picture, making this a must-see for horror fans and 80’s gore aficionados.
