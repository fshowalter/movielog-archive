_Don't Breathe_ wastes a great setup.

The story sees a teen trio burgle a blind man's dilapidated Detroit home. But the mark proves resourceful, and soon the kids are fighting to escape.

The film shines during the kids' first encounter with the blind man. These scenes crackle with palpable tension. I gasped aloud when one character revealed his presence via a creaky floorboard.

Then the script ruins everything.

Forced plotting masquerading as cleverness plagues the film. Consider the kids removing their shoes when they enter the house. Later, the blind man smells the shoe pile to discern the number of people inside his home. Using one improbable act to set up another isn't clever, it's lazy writing.

The film teams with it. Like the kids searching everywhere save the bedroom. Or later, when the trapped kids flee into the cellar. Or everything after that.

As time passed, I lost patience. The script ignores the obvious. The man is blind. Grab a hammer, hide behind a door, and brain him.

A sense of humor might have saved it. But the film piles one outlandish plot twist upon another without even a wink toward its own inanity. Worse still, it gets downright ugly, insulting more than our intelligence.

The premise holds potential, but the execution frustrates. The more I think about _Don't Breathe_, the less I like it.
