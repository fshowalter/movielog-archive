There's tension aplenty but logic is in short supply.

Don't Breathe offers ample tension but little logic.

The plot sees a group of teens break into a blind man's home in search of cash. The script offers an explanation for a man holding so much cash in his dilapidated house, but it only makes sense in retrospect. Like much of the film, the characters seem to act logically, but upon reflection are just puppets in serve of the plot.

Consider when the kids find themselves trapped in the man's home. The man, who turns out to be something of an aged Wolverine, is armed and chasing them. Where do the kids flee? Why the cellar, of course! Because that's a natural instinct when trying to escape a house.

Or even earlier, when the kids take off thier shoes when entering the house. Ostensibly to avoid making noise, yet in a creaky old house like that, does it matter? And what if they had to escape quickly? Or even beyond that where, once inside, thier plan seems to be to search everywhere but the bedroom. You know, the one place folks would likely keep a large amount of cash?

To the film's credit, it manages to keep you from realizing these logic gaps by ratcheting up the on screen tension to visceral levels. I let out a rare gasp when a character gave away his presence via a creaky floorboard.

But as the film goes on this becomes unsustainable. Plot twists supplant tension as the distraction of choice. These become increasingly implausabile. Though may be titled don't breathe, by the end the filmmakers are hoping we don't think.
