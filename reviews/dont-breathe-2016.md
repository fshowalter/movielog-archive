Don't Breathe offers ample tension but little logic.

The plot sees a trio of teens break into a blind man's home in search of cash. There's a reason the man's keeping so much money in his dilapidated house, but the kids couldn't have known it when they planned the robbery.

And that the film's biggest problem: it makes no sense. The script proffers explanations via awkward exposition, but it's not enough. A character's actions should feel inevitable, here they feel obligatory.

Consider how the kids leave their shoes by the door when they enter the house. Not to avoid making noise as they walk, but so the man can later smell the shoes and learn the number of people in his house.

The forced plotting continues with the kids searching everywhere in the house save the man's bedroom. The script doesn't even try to explain this one.

I reached my limit when the kids, trapped and running from the pistol wielding man, flee into the cellar. Because where else would one run when trying to escape a house?

To the film's credit, it distracts you from these logic gaps by ratcheting the tension to visceral levels. I let out an audible gasp when one character gave away his presence via a creaky floorboard.

But the film can't sustain this approach. As it wears on, plot twists replace tension. It's already suspect logic goes out the window as gross-outs supplant suspense.

By this point, I'd lost patience. The man may pack a pistol and a mean left hook, but he's still blind. Grab a hammer, crowbar, or similar tool, hide behind a door, and club him when he enters the room.

Instead of Don't Breathe, they should have called it Don't Think.
