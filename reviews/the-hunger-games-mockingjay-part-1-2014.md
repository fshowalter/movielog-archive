Full disclosure: I haven’t seen the first two Hunger Games films, nor have I read the books.

That said, the film does an admirable job bringing new viewers up to speed. Our heroine, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) has just destroyed the titular Hunger Games, dealing a symbolic blow to the Evil Capitol. Rebel forces have rescued her, but they were unable to rescue her true love Peeta, who’s now in the Evil Capitol’s clutches.

In offering a plot summary, I find myself at a loss. Katniss frets about Peeta, walks through some rubble-strewn towns, and frets about Peeta some more. There’s little-to-no plot, and the characters end the film more-or-less where they started. You could edit the film down to fifteen minutes and tell the same story.

But The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is not fifteen minutes. It’s just over two hours long. Two hours of nothing but filler. It’s inexcusable.

A movie doesn’t need action. A quiet meditation on Katniss caught as pawn between the two forces vying for control of a dystopian society could be interesting. But the film deals in absolutes. The Heroic Rebels versus the Evil Capitol. With no gray area, the film loses any shot at creditable political commentary.

Jennifer Lawrence is a talented actress capable of commanding our attention on screen, but one wouldn’t know it from watching this movie. Between the ill-fitting jumpsuit and pale makeup, she looks every bit as listless as the script. Her supporting cast includes Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore. Both manage to avoid rolling their eyes at the dialog. A feat I consider award-worthy.

Watching The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 felt like watching the deleted scenes from a better movie where things actually happen. This is a non-movie that exists only to gouge fans for the cost of an extra ticket. Fans would do well to save their money and time and skip to the real finale in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2.
