Full disclosure: I haven't seen the first two _Hunger Games_ films, nor have I read the books. 

That said, the film did an admirable job of bringing me up to speed. Our heroine, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) has just destroyed the titular Hunger Games, dealing a symbolic blow to the evil Capitol. Rebel forces have rescued her, but they were unable to rescue her true love Peeta, who's now in the Capitol's clutches.

This is the part where I try and tell you what the movie was about. But I am at a loss. Watching this film felt like watching the deleted scenes from a better movie. A movie where things actually happen. _The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1_ has little to no plot, and the characters end the film more or less where they started. Katniss frets about Peeta, walks through a lot of rubble-strewn towns, and frets about Peeta some more. You could condense the entire film into fifteen minutes and not lose a thing.

But _The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1_ is not fifteen minutes. It's just over two hours long. Two hours of nothing but filler. It’s inexcusable.

Now, I’m not saying a movie needs action. A meditation on Katniss being caught as pawn between the two forces vying for control of a dystopian society could be interesting if the sides weren't so black and white. The capital is evil and the rebels are good. With no gray area, the film loses any shot at a creditable political commentary.

Jennifer Lawrence is a good actress capable of commanding your attention on screen, but you wouldn't know it from watching this movie. Between the ill-fitting jump suit and pale makeup, she looks every bit as listless as the script. Her supporting cast includes Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore. To their credit, they do a good job of not rolling their eyes at the dialog.

_The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1_ is a non-movie. It has no reason to exist outside of gouging fans of the series for the cost of an extra ticket. Just skip straight to the real finale in  _The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2_.
