Fair warning, I’m going to spoil the entire plot of _British Intelligence_. I see no other way to review the film. Plot is all it has to offer.

It’s World War I and the British are hurting. The Germans seem to know every move they’re about to make before they make it. The British suspect someone in their organization is the famed German spy Strendler. But no one knows what Strendler looks like. The British resign to pulling their best spy from field duty to weed out Strendler. But even that plan leaks to the Germans, who kill the British agent and shoot down his extraction plane. The pilot, Frank Bennett, survives and we see him in a hospital being tended to by a nurse, Helene von Lorbeer (Margaret Lindsay). There’s an attraction between the two, but she says she has to leave.

Von Lorbeer turns out to be a German spy. She’s recalled to headquarters, given a commendation and a new assignment. Posing as a refugee, she’s to infiltrate the house of British cabinet minister Arthur Bennett. Arthur is, of course, Frank’s father.

Von Lorbeer ingratiates herself with the Bennett family. Her contact is the family butler Valdar (Boris Karloff). Unbeknownst to von Lorbeer, Valdar is a double-agent, reporting to the head of British Intelligence. After some sloppy code-passing, British Intelligence begin to suspect von Lorbeer. They set a trap involving a would-be German agent, but von Lorbeer sees through it.

The return of Frank Bennett prompts von Lorbeer to reveal that she’s actually a _British_ agent. Valdar overhears this and forces von Lorbeer into the cellar at gunpoint. Von Lorbeer explains that she had to make up the British agent story to allay Frank’s suspicions. After showing the commendation award she received from German command, Valdar believes her story and admits that he is, in fact, Strendler. Further, the British cabinet are meeting upstairs and Valdar plans to blow up the house under the guise of a Zeppelin bombing. He’s even stolen the plans for the next British offensive.

But the authorities have Valdar under surveillance and they rush into the cellar in time to disarm the bomb. Valdar flees with the plans. He’s shot during his escape but makes it to a German safe house. Just as they’re about to transmit the plans, a Zeppelin bomb levels the building.

That’s a lot of plot. The labyrinthine twists of agents, double agents, and triple agents, leaves little room for characterization. But maybe that’s by design. Characterization requires some degree of plausibility, and the more one thinks about this film, the more it devolves into a series of flimsy revelations and deus ex machina.

Consider Valdar’s big reveal that he is Strendler. If Valdar was working for the British he would have told them about von Lorbeer, making the ruse involving the fake German agent unnecessary. But if Valdar didn’t tell the British about von Lorbeer, how did they know her handler’s code phrases? Surely, things like that wouldn’t be reused between agents. And just how did Valdar acquire so much information? It would seem that his intelligence gathering consists of little-more than standing outside thin doors or open windows. As a butler he wouldn’t be privy to any intelligence discussed at a secure location.

Worse still, even at only an hour and six minutes, _British Intelligence_ is too long. The lengthy opening sequence only exists to introduce Frank Bennett, who disappears for much of the film, only to surface a few minutes before the end. Why not start with von Lorbeer undercover? She’d be a sympathetic character we’d actually care about, at least until her reveal as a German spy, which would have been a good one.

At least Karloff is good in what amounts to a triple role. It's nice to see him work outside the horror genre, but he can’t save this mess.
