I was about to start high school when this movie came out. I was too young to see it, not that I wanted to. It was the eighth entry in what had become a disregarded franchise. Slasher films were passé.

Despite all that, I remember this movie's release. This was well before the internet was a household thing, but that didn't stop the news from spreading. In a film called _Jason Takes Manhattan_, Jason didn't actually get to New York until the last twenty minutes or so. 

The movie opens on Crystal Lake[^1]. A couple of high school kids are fooling around on a boat. An unfortunate sequence of events sees Jason resurrected from his watery grave via electricity. He makes short work of the two teens, reclaiming his trademark hockey mask in the process[^2].

Fast-forward to the following morning. The _SS Lazarus_[^3] is about to set sail for New York City, with the local graduating high school class on board. One of the kids, Rennie, is late to arrive. She was reluctant to come, due to a deep fear of the water after almost drowning as a child. Her English teacher, Miss Van Deusen, convinced her. Van Deusen is chaperoning the trip along with Mr. McCulloch, a pompous biology teacher who’s also Rennie’s uncle and legal guardian. McCulloch isn’t happy, but Rennie is determined to go.

As they set off, Jason sneaks on board and begins picking off the teens. While he goes about his work we’re presented with a series of sub-plots. 

Rennie has visions of a small boy drowning. Haughty prom queen Tamara tries to blackmail McCulloch by seducing him on video. The captain’s son, Sean, fails to live up to his father’s expectation that he do the nautical equivalent of backing the car out of the garage. Another teen, Julius, shows he’s a hell of a boxer[^4].

After a while, Jason kills the captain. Sean discovers his father’s body and alerts the rest of the passengers. The kids arm themselves and attempt to hunt down Jason. But a series of events causes the ship to sink. Sean, Rennie, Julius, McCulloch and Van Deusen manage to get into a life boat and row to the shores of New York City.

But Jason’s right behind them, determined to finish what he started aboard the boat. The finale sees Rennie and Sean running from Jason through a sewer tunnel that’s due to be flushed with toxic waste. 

This installment was the lowest grossing entry in the series. But that’s less a reflection on this film and more a confirmation that the previous installment, _Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988)_, killed the franchise. _That_ film was awful. This movie is bad, but nowhere near _that_ level of terrible.

Granted, much like the previous film, this entry saddles the protagonist with a useless melodramatic sub plot. But the supporting cast here is far more tolerable. And the film doesn’t take itself too seriously. There are a couple of good laughs[^5].

And yes, the majority of the film does take place on a boat. But if it didn’t have the Manhattan title, I doubt fans would have minded so much. At this point in the series, _any_ change of scenery would be welcome. 

Indeed, the most disappointing aspect of this entry is not how long it takes to get to New York. It’s that once it gets there, Jason gets tunnel vision. He doesn’t care about anyone but the people from the boat. He walks through swaths of pedestrians and ignores them. Jason in a major city should be a one-man apocalypse, killing anyone and anything within reach. He does off some street punks, but that's about it. 

To that end, _Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan_ is more disappointing than awful. Aside from a change of scenery, it doesn’t offer anything we haven’t seen done better before.

[^1]: Is Crystal Lake an inlet now? The film doesn’t make it clear.

[^2]: This is ridiculous. One of the kids gets a hockey mask to scare the other, but it happens to be the exact same kind Jason wore. Right down to the chunk missing due to the axe-to-the-face Jason suffered at the end of _Friday the 13th Part III (1982)_.

[^3]: Good name.

[^4]: Because, why wouldn’t a school-sponsored trip to New York City include a little boxing on the way?

[^5]: Two scenes made me chuckle. The first was the culmination of the fight between Jason and Julius. The second was when Jason flips up his mask to the street gang after knocking over their boom-box. Good bits.
