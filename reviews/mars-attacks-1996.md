Mars Attacks is a good little movie spliced into a mediocre big one.

The script spoofs the alien invasion pictures of the fifties and the disaster pictures of the seventies. The alien invasion stuff works, the sprawling disaster stuff doesn’t. The result is an overlong, sometimes inspired, often tedious mashup that never reaches its potential.

It’s telling that in a cast featuring Jack Nicholson (in a dual role!), Glenn Close, Annette Bening, and Pierce Brosnan, it’s former Clevand Browns fullback Jim Brown who seems most comfortable. While everyone else overacts, Brown plays it straight, but never takes himself too seriously.

He plays a washed-up world champion heavyweight boxer reduced to dressing up as a pharaoh for an Egyptian-themed casino in Las Vegas. When the Martians attack, Brown sets out for Washington D.C. to reunite with his ex-wife and kids. He gets some help from Tom Jones, who plays himself.

It’s just the sort of goofball casting that matches the goofy sci-fi premise. Director Tim Burton seems at home here, channeling Ed Wood’s so-bad-they’re-good features. But he’d become a victim of his own success. After launching the commercial powerhouse Batman franchise, and the critically acclaimed Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood, everyone wanted to work with him. But rather than lead with a story, Burton takes an idea and writes a movie for his juggernaut cast.

The rest of the big-name cast just takes up screen time that would be better used by the Martians. They’re the real star. They aren’t so much evil as _mean_. In my favorite scene, they laser a national monument, then catch the falling debris with their flying saucer to redirect it toward a tour group.

Bits like this are great, but the film doesn’t contain enough of them. Instead, it introduces a slew of disparate storylines involving the president, a pair of television personalities, and a Las Vegas developer and his new age girlfriend. Despite the big-name cast, none of these characters are very memorable.
