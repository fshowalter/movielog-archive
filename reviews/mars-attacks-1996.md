_Mars Attacks!_ could have been awful but settles for mediocre.

The story involves aliens from Mars attacking Earth. The script jumps between several storylines: the President and his staff, a pair of television personalities, a family in rural Kansas, a sleazy Las Vegas developer, and a washed up heavyweight boxer. Jack Nicholson leads an all-star cast as both the President and the Vegas developer.

The studio advertised the film as spoofing 1950s science-fiction pictures, but it doesn’t play that way. Among the cast, it's telling that amateur actor and former Cleveland Browns fullback Jim Brown seems the most comfortable. He plays the boxer reduced to dressing as a pharaoh for an Egyptian-themed casino. When the Martians attack, Brown heads out to reunite with his ex-wife (Pam Grier) and kids. He gets some help from Tom Jones, who plays himself. There’s a wonderful scene where Brown asks Jones, “Do you know how to fly a plane?” to which Jones replies, “Of course! You got one?”

This sort of goofball casting matches the goofy sci-fi premise. For a moment, _Mars Attacks!_ works. Brown and Jones both seem aware of their shortcomings as actors, and their stiff performances are genuine and entertaining.

It’s a glimpse of the movie I suspect director Tim Burton longed to make. He seems less interested in spoofing the genre than recreating it.

That’s not a bad idea, but no one told the big-name cast. Except for Brosnan and Short, they all convey a sense of condescension. They ham it up with performances that scream “I’m overacting on purpose!”.

Did they have a choice? Unlike Brown and Jones, the rest of the cast can’t pretend they’re amateur actors and playing it straight wouldn’t have helped. Pam Grier plays her role with such conviction, her scenes feel spliced in from a different film. Martin Short plays his role as though he were in an overt comedy and suffers a similar fate.

At least they got the Martians right. The 1950s films featured serious monsters cobbled together with silly effects. Here, we get over-the-top cartoonish monsters brought to life with no visible wires, seams, or zippers. In my favorite scene, the Martians laser a national monument, catch the falling debris with their flying saucer, and redirect the rubble onto a fleeing tour group. Maybe if Burton didn’t have to devote so much screen time to his A-list cast, he could have included more bits like this. In the end, _Mars Attacks!_ wants to be a so-bad-it’s-good B-movie, but can’t escape A-list mediocrity.
