I know where _Interstellar_ went wrong. I knew the instant it happened. I may have let out a small groan. But I’m getting ahead of myself.

It’s three or four generations into the future. The earth is drying up. Giant dust storms ravage the land. Blight has wiped out all the world’s crops except corn.

Matthew McConaughey plays Cooper, a former test pilot/engineer who, like just about everyone else, has been forced into farming to survive. He hates it, but he does it to support his two young children.

A series of gravitational anomalies lead him to the remnants of NASA. NASA has a plan to save humanity. They’ve discovered a wormhole near Saturn. On the other side are potentially hospitable worlds. They’ve got a ship and crew ready. They just need a pilot.

Cooper agrees, even though the length of the journey means he’ll miss years of his children’s lives. If he makes it back at all.

The flight goes smoothly and the crew passes through the wormhole in a sequence that begs favorable comparisons with _2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)_. On the other side they assess their situation. There are three potential worlds, but the closest and most promising orbits the outskirts of a black hole. This creates a warping effect with time. An hour spent on the surface of the planet equates to seven years back on earth.

They agree to be quick. Cooper pilots a shuttle craft with two other scientists down to the planet's surface. The plan is to be in-and-out, but of course, there are complications. They return to the main craft just over three hours later, only to find that twenty three years have passed on earth. Cooper checks the equivalent of his mail in the form of video messages. He sees his son graduate high school, meet a girl, and get married. He sees the birth and death of his grandson. Finally, he sees his son, now a man older than himself, say goodbye, resigned that Cooper is never coming back. Cooper has missed it all. It flattens him and us. Never has a movie conveyed the isolation of space travel like this.

Then, Cooper gets a message from his daughter. They had a rough falling out as he left. She felt he was abandoning her. Now, she’s a full grown woman, the same age as him. But she’s still bitter at him for leaving.

And this brings us to the point I mentioned earlier. The point where Interstellar loses its way. The film cuts to Cooper’s daughter as she finishes her message. Now we’re back on earth. No longer alone. Now, we have parallel stories, Cooper in space and Cooper’s family on earth. What started as a meditation on mankind transcending earth devolves into a predictable melodrama. The effects are fantastic, and there are some nail-biting set pieces, but the film has nothing new to say.

It’s tempting to think that _Interstellar_’s reach exceeded its grasp. That it tried and failed. I don’t think it tried at all. Rather than explore new themes it settled for the comfort of familiar dramatic scenarios. Granted, it executes those tropes with masterful precision. But _Interstellar_ had the chance to transcend the science fiction genre. Instead, it abandoned it.
