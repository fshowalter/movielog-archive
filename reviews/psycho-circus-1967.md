_Circus of Fear_ (_Psycho Circus_, here in the US) opens with a shot of Klaus Kinski's wrist watch. He's part of a group of thieves preparing to execute a daylight holdup of an armored car as it crosses London's Tower bridge. There's no dialog. The crooks work on a precise timetable. Two men setup a road block to divert oncoming traffic, then rush to setup the escape route. Two others take out the escort car and maneuver the armored car to the other side of the bridge. Kinski knocks out the bridge operator and raises the bridge. Everything goes according to plan until one of the thieves panics and shoots one of the guards.

At this point, one can imagine theater-goers in 1966 wondering if they were in the right theater. There's no sign of a circus or top-billed Christopher Lee. As if to assure those confused patrons, the opening titles fade in as the crooks make good on their escape. There's even a catchy title theme.

Unfortunately, the rest of the film never matches this inspired opening.

It turns out the entire heist was a MacGuffin. In the span of a few minutes, all the crooks, save Kinski, are killed off. This was a German co-production and Kinski was a big star in Germany. He seems to be here strictly for name recognition, as he spends the rest of the movie doing nothing but lurking about in the shadows.

The setting shifts to the winter home of the Barberini circus. The pacing slows. Things get talky. Over twenty minutes in, Christopher Lee finally shows up as a lion tamer who spends most of the film wearing a black balaclava. Leo Genn plays a police inspector trying to find the stolen money.

From here, the movie devolves into an unremarkable whodunit. An unseen, knife-throwing assailant picks off potential suspects.  There are lots of red herrings and at least one plot twist you'll likely see coming before everything is wrapped up. All well and good, but a much more interesting mystery is what the cast and crew could have done with a better script.
