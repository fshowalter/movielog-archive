Were I forced to pick two movies to last the rest of my life, one would be _Rio Bravo_. The other would be a backup copy of _Rio Bravo_.

This marks my 101st review since I relaunched this site back in 2014. Prior to that, I struggled to review every film I saw. Keeping pace with my movie-watching habit meant cranking out reviews at a relentless pace.

With the relaunch, I refocused on quality over quantity. I strove for a journalistic approach. A good review should describe the film and how I felt about it, with the sum result conveying a sense of the film's quality. I tried to avoid telling things, but a cursory look through the prior 100 reviews reveals ample failures.

Consider this line, from my review of _Maléfique (2002)_:

> As Carrère, Gérald Laroche provides a grounded audience surrogate whose gradual transformation into a bitter convict carries the film.

What does that mean? How does it carry the film?

Or this bit, from my review of _Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961)_:

> Patricia Neal plays the rich, married woman who pays Paul's rent and keeps him in nice clothes. She makes an impression by underplaying her role.

How does she underplay the role?

Or from my review of _Giallo a Venezia (1979)_:

> The murders—particularly the prostitute's—are uninspired and ugly.

What makes them uninspired and ugly? I'm not describing the murders, I'm describing my reaction to them, but not calling that out as opinion.

At least I was honest in my review of _Two Evil Eyes (1990)_:

> Romero's segment has a made-for-TV feel. I can't identify the exact cause. Perhaps it's the under-written characters, or the under-furnished sets. Or the flat lighting. Maybe it's the stiff performances. Or the EC Comics style twist ending.

Lest you think I'm being hard on myself, consider the outright nonsense I've written as well.

From my review of _My Bloody Valentine (1981)_, written just last week:

> My Bloody Valentine proves you can defy the tropes while still staying true to the genre.

Lines like that make me wonder if I'm wasting my time. The film premiered in 1981. What tropes could it defy?

Practice makes perfect, but practice requires feedback.

Stephen King writes for his wife. I envy him. My wife reads my reviews when I ask, though for her it's a chore. She prefers a different kind of review, one that's more explicit about the film. Reading my reviews, she provides great feedback but she's not enamored with the final product. Thus, I'm reluctant to ask.

I've tried adding comments to the site. The few non-spam entries readers left were reactions to my opinions, not the writing itself. Fair enough, considering my traffic logs say all my readers come via referrals; reading a single review then leaving, likely never to return.

Readers come for information about a specific movie, not for the writing itself. It's time I admit it. Constant reader, you don't exist.

So why bother? 

I ask myself that a lot these days.

The answer is my daughters. Neither is yet old enough to read, so they can't offer any feedback. But they're my audience. If I maintain my current pace, I'll have written several hundred reviews by the time they're old enough to watch R-rated movies. Long after I'm gone, they could watch a movie and read my impressions. It's my stab at transcending death. 

Which makes my failures as a writer all the more painful. That said, should a review fail my quality standards, it's not immutable. A future rewrite could say tomorrow what I struggle to say today. Provided I solve the feedback problem.

But back to _Rio Bravo_.

John Wayne stars as John T. Chance, sheriff of Presidio County, Texas. He's holding Joe Burdette for murder. Joe's brother, Nathan is a wealthy land baron. Nathan recruits a slew of mercenaries to free Joe. Chance's only allies are his drunken deputy Dude, played by Dean Martin, a crippled old curmudgeon named Stumpy, played by Walter Brennan, a young gunslinger named Colorado, played by Ricky Nelson, and a showgirl turned gambler named Feathers, played by Angie Dickinson.

The script establishes the premise in the first ten minutes, with almost no dialog. From there, the film unfolds at a languid pace. There are flashes of action, but much of the film sees the cast sitting or standing around indoors, talking or reacting to one-another.

And here is where I falter. I'm not sure why the film works so well. I can point to the charisma of Wayne and Martin, but that's only part of it. The film speaks to something deeper. A good chunk of the film revolves around Chance rehabilitating Dude. Chance doesn't coddle him, but it's not "tough love" either. Chance believes Dude will come around. For Dude, the desire to live up to that faith is stronger than any addiction.

It's a wonderful male fantasy, and for two hours and change, you believe it. Chance is an idealized big-brother/father figure. He's the strong, honest, capable, professional man we want to be. Dude is the flawed, vulnerable man we feel we are. Chance's faith in Dude is Chance's faith in us. Watching _Rio Bravo_ is a low-key cathartic experience. The most powerful scenes are wordless or book-ended with comic relief. It's not a heavy film, but it punches above its weight.

And about the comic relief. Much of it comes via Walter Brennan's character, but repeat viewings have lent a comedic shade to many of Wayne's lines. Like Billy Wilder's best films, _Rio Bravo_ uses comedy as a subtle distraction. When Chance says, "Sorry don't get it done Dude," we feel the message but smirk at the delivery.

I'm closing in on a thousand words and I haven't touched on Angie Dickinson's performance or Dimitri Tiomkin's score. I could devote a couple hundred words to each and not do them justice.

But more words won't help explain the film's greatness. One could write a book analyzing the film but I suspect only the author would enjoy it. _Rio Bravo_ taps into universal emotions it never acknowledges. We interpret the unsaid undercurrents based on our own experiences. Over-explaining things would force a singular interpretation which would alienate the reader.

Maybe that's me trying to justify my shortcoming as a writer. Fair enough, but I've seen more times than I can count, yet continue to enjoy more with every new viewing. There's something magical in that.
