Much of the joy in watching _The Sentinel_ comes from spotting the once and future stars peppering the cast.

Allow me to spoil a few. José Ferrer as an unnamed robed figure. Ava Gardner as a peppy real estate agent. Burgess Meredith as a creepy neighbor. Eli Wallach as a cagey detective. Jeff Goldblum as a photographer.

A variation of this game involves spotting the once and future stars with non-speaking roles. Among them, we have Beverly D’Angelo as a mute exhibitionist, Christopher Walden as Wallach’s grinning partner, and an almost unrecognizable John Carradine as an aging priest.

Set in New York City, the plot sees X plays a model living with her boyfriend, a wealthy hot-shot attorney played by Chris Sarandon. They're happy together, but she wants a place of her own. She's discouraged after visiting several dingy downtown apartments in her price-range, then discovers a amazing furnished apartment with fantastic views. Upon moving in, a series of strange occurrences involving her eccentric neighbors leaves her on edge. Y investigates, uncovering a horrific conspiracy.

The film plays as a B-grade _Rosemary’s Baby (1968)_. The makeup and effects provide some shocking visuals, but many performances veer into camp. Beverly D’Angelo gives a fearless performance, but ends up betrayed by the editing and direction, which renders her scenes laughable instead of disturbing. At least her performance was memorable, unlike Eli Wallach, who phones in his turn as a detective who can’t let go of a case. It’s so stereotypical we can’t help but laugh at some of his scenes.

But what saved the film for me was Chris Sarandon. Despite sporting a mustache that only adds to the film's second-rate feel, Sarandon is perfect in his role. He avoids the idiot plot and acts according to character. And there's just something about him playing a charming but ruthless character that I enjoy.

_The Sentinel_ is not a good film, but I enjoyed it. The first time I saw it, I thought it a big-budget production of a grindhouse script. Watching it now, I stand by that assessment. Like many a grindhouse picture, it doesn’t hold up well to repeat viewings, but Chris Sarandon was every bit as good as I remembered.
