-:pull_quote: It's not a good sign when the making-of featurette on the DVD is more interesting than the feature film, but such is the case with _The Bloody Judge_.

_The Bloody Judge_ takes place in England during the final days of King James II. Christopher Lee plays George Jeffreys, the infamous judge who meted out death sentences to suppress the burgeoning rebellion. These sham trials became known as the Bloody Assizes. 

In a making-of featurette, Lee describes Jeffreys as a Jekyll-and-Hyde figure. Both a brilliant legal mind and a merciless executioner. Had the film focused on this dichotomy, it might have worked.

Instead, the film revolves around a fictitious love triangle. Jeffreys obsesses over Mary, a peasant girl. Mary's lover, Harry, is part of the rebellion. Jeffreys wants to arrest Harry, but Harry's father is a political ally. Instead, Jeffreys arrests Mary. Harry frees her. Jeffreys captures them both. They escape. Then the revolution happens.

There's also a blind oracle who may or may not be psychic.

It's a mess of disparate plot points. The film had multiple financiers and each wanted a different film. One wanted a horror movie. One wanted a historical drama. Another wanted an exploitation picture. The filmmakers tried to please everyone. 

At least no one wanted a comedy.

Compounding matters, Lee and director Jesús Franco disagreed on how to portray Jeffreys. Lee wanted historical accuracy.  Franco wanted something more "dynamic." I don't know what he meant by "dynamic" and I don't think Lee did either.

The resulting mishmash is dull and disjointed. Think long, wooden, scenes leaden with exposition, interrupted by an occasional bit of exploitation[^1]. Things pick up when the revolution rolls around, but not enough to make this worthwhile.

The financing amalgam also explains the myriad of alternate titles. In the United States it was _Night of the Blood Monster_. In England it was _Witch Killer of Broadmoor_, even though there's no Broadmoor in the film. Granted, there's no Blood Monster either, but why Broadmoor? That's one question the making-of featurette couldn't answer.

[^1]:  In this case, a man dressed like Boris Karloff in _The Tower of London (1939)_, torturing a semi-nude woman covered in Technicolor blood.  If you're in it for these bits, I recommend liberal use of the fast-forward button.
