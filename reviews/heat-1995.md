I tilt forward in my seat. My heels rise. The balls of my feet press into the floor. My hands clench tight and I realize I'm holding my breath. _Heat_ on the big screen is an experience.

I've seen the film several times, yet the centerpiece shootout scene in the streets of downtown Los Angeles always elicits a visceral reaction.

Boiled down, it's a cops and robbers story. Robert De Niro leads a crew of professional thieves taking down a series of Los Angeles scores. Al Pacino leads the cops in pursuit.

De Niro plans the heists with military precision, yet lives alone in a palatial seaside estate that could pass for vacant. Pacino hunts De Niro's crew with obsessive fervor, even as his third marriage crumbles around him. These aren't people, they're archetypes in the Howard Hawks tradition—professions personified.

De Niro and Pacino rise to the occasion. To borrow a line from another film—De Niro is so icy cool, when he goes to bed, sheep count him. And Pacino—to quote his own character—is ferocious. They're supported by the likes of Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Hank Azaria, William Fichtner, and Danny Trejo, to name a few. The sheer number of familiar faces in non-flashy roles reminded me of the old John Ford and Howard Hawks stock companies.

I keep coming back to Hawks. To a large degree, _Heat_ feels like a Hawks picture, right down to the underwritten female characters.

But Hawks never pulled off this kind of epic. The aforementioned shootout carries an immense gravitas because everything about it feels authentic. From the way the characters fire short bursts and reload, to their tactical movements, it all resonates. Hawks strove for authenticity but lacked modern special effects. Not to mention no studio would have backed a nearly 3-hour film with a downbeat ending.

That's not to say writer/director Michael Mann values authenticity over drama. His kinetic editing includes plenty of long and wide shots to establish movement and geography, immersing us in the scene. We don't witness the gunfight we _experience_ it. And said experience stays with us long after the credits roll.
