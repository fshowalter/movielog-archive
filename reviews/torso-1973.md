_Torso_ features a masked killer stalking a group of college students. Though this description calls to mind countless low-budget slashers, _Torso_ stands apart.

It has a real story. The killer’s identity is kept secret. We get countless red herrings. Pretty much every man is a suspect, and that’s key. The film’s original title translates to "Bodies bear traces of carnal violence” and the underlying theme is sexual violence against women. Again, while this calls to mind the tired sex-equals-death trope that dominated 80s horror, _Torso_ stands apart.

The film paints its heroines as strong, independent women. When the murders begin, they band together and seek refuge in a cliffside villa. While not a great strategic move, it’s refreshing to see them do something other than run to the nearest man for protection.

But what really sets _Torso_ apart is the exquisite cinematography. There’s a scene early, where the killer tracks a girl through a swampy marsh. The lighting, camerawork, and setting come together to create a kinetic claustrophobia. It’s a stylistic triumph reminiscent of Hitchcock. One you can appreciate while remaining immersed in the narrative.

And it gets better. There’s a scene where one of the girls finds herself locked in a bedroom. She slides a piece of newspaper under the door in the hopes of catching the key as she forces it out of the lock. Just as she does—

Well, I’m not going to spoil it. Suffice it to say the film’s final twenty-or-so minutes are almost dialog-free, and exist as a master class in suspense. They’re so good, we can forgive the killer’s awkward exposition as he explains his psychosis.
