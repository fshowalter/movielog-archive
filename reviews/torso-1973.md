_Torso_ executes a generic plot with panache.

The film takes place in scenic Perugia, Italy. We meet a group of female students attending the local university. A series of murders by a masked killer spooks them. One thinks she recognizes the murder weapon. She and the others seek refuge in a cliff-side villa. The killer, of course, follows.

It plays as a mystery, inviting us to guess killer’s identity. The script proffers a myriad of suspects, painting almost every male character as possessive, misogynistic, or perverted. The few that appear normal feel suspect by comparison. I thought I knew who the killer was, but guessed wrong.

Mystery aside, what I enjoyed most about _Torso_ was its style. There’s a scene where the killer tracks a girl through a swampy marsh. The lighting, camerawork, and editing create a kind of kinetic claustrophobia. The more she runs, the more her world shrinks. Even as the tension held me rapt, the sheer craft made me smile.

And it gets better. Later, a woman finds herself locked in a bedroom. She slides a piece of newspaper under the door, hoping to catch the key as she forces it out of the lock. Just as she does…

I won’t spoil it. Instead, I’ll say the film’s final twenty-or-so minutes are almost dialog-free and serve as a master class in suspense. They’re so good, I forgave the finale, which sees the killer reveal his identity and explain his psychosis via some awkward and disappointing exposition.

My only problem with _Torso_ lies with its heroines. I liked how the film paints them as strong, independent women. Fleeing to a remote outpost wasn't the smartest move, but it was refreshing to see them do something besides run to the nearest man for protection. But they lacked distinct personalities. Aside from Suzy Kendall’s character, the women felt interchangeable and never endeared themselves. It’s a common problem with mysteries. We learn more about the various red herrings than about the protagonists.
