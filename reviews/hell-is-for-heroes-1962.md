:pull_quote: _Hell Is for Heroes_ saw Steve McQueen piss off the cast, crew and studio, yet still make a good movie.

_Hell is for Heroes_ opens in France in the fall of 1944. A small squad of US soldiers is enjoying a much-needed break behind the lines. Private John Reese, played by Steve McQueen arrives to join the squad. Reese is a former master sergeant demoted down to private. He's quickly alienates himself from the rest of the squad and disobeys orders by wandering down to the local tavern for a drink. While the rest of the squad is giddy over the rumours that they'll soon be transfered state-side, Reese is morose.

But, of course, the squad isn't going home. Orders come through sending them back to the line. An unexpecded withdrawl of the existing American forces leaves the squad outnumbered against the German forces on the opposite side. The German's don't realize it, but it's only a matter of time. The squad rigs up a series of schemes to project an illusion of strength, but soon the Germans send a reconnaissance team. Reese and company kill most of the German team but a few make it back across the line.

Believing their only chance is to attack a German pillbox across the line, Reese convinces a couple of other soldiers to join him. The men, acting without orders, make their way across the mine-leaden no-man's land with disasterous results.

_Hell is for Heroes_ should have been a disaster. Robert Pirosh wrote the script and planned to produce and direct. Once star Steve McQueen came aboard, the two men clashed over script changes. McQueen wanted to the other cast member's roles diminished and his beefed up. McQueen got his way and Pirosh walked. The studio installed Don Siegal as director. McQueen's antics had already aliented him from most of the cast, and he clashed with Siegal as production went on.

And yet, despite all this (or perhaps because of it), the film works. McQueen is great as a mentally scarred loner who you'd be hard pressed to like, yet would love to have next to you in a foxhole. The only other cast-member who comes close to registering opposite McQueen is a young James Coburn. Coburn plays Henshaaw, a habitual tinkerer who struggles with the madness of war. During the sequences involving the German reconnassance team, Coburn delivers a haunting scene as he mans a flame-thrower.


On the opposite end of the spectrum, Nick Adams overdoes his part as a Polish refugee, and Bob Newhart is simply out of place doing a variation of his standup shtick in what's otherwise a gritty picture.

The film seems to have had little budget for special effects. During one of the film's most famous scenes, a soldier screams "MY GUTS!" while clutching his stomach after being shot. The performance is powerful. The screams go on, tinged with mania. It would be painful to watch if there were actual blood. Instead we're given bloodless wounds and carnage free explosions.

And now we come to the hear of the conundrum that is _Hell is for Heroes_. By multiple accounts the film's abrupt ending was born out of the same lack of finances. The film simply ran out of money and so it ended. Yet it's a perfect ending. The war doesn't end. The fighting goes on.
