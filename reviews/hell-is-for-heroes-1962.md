:pull_quote: _Hell Is for Heroes_ saw Steve McQueen piss off the cast, crew and studio, yet still make a good movie.

_Hell Is for Heroes_ tells the story of a small squad of American soldiers. It’s 1944, and the group has seen its share of action on the European lines. Now, they’re enjoying a break in a bombed-out French village near the Siegfried Line. 

Private John Reese, played by Steve McQueen, arrives with orders to join the squad. Reese, a former master sergeant demoted down to private for insubordination, wastes little time alienating himself from the rest of the men. Rumors swirl that the squad’s next orders might send them back home. The men are giddy. Reese is forlorn. The war has become his life. Later that night, he disobeys orders and heads into town for a drink. 

But, of course, the squad doesn’t go home. Orders come through sending them back to the line. Reese brightens. On the line, he’s an exemplary soldier, calm but vigilant. Good thing, because the existing American forces soon withdraw, leaving the squad horribly outnumbered. The men rig up a series of schemes to project an illusion of strength, but the Germans soon learn the truth.

With the undermanned squad unable to withstand a German attack, Reese pushes to attack a German pillbox across the line. This would force the Germans into a defensive position. Reese gets orders to stay put while the acting officer leaves to notify command. Reese disregards his orders and convinces two other squad members to join him on a raid. Acting without orders, the men make their way across the mine-leaden no-man’s land with disastrous results.

Given the troubled production, the film should have been a mess. Robert Pirosh wrote the script and planned to produce and direct. Once McQueen came aboard, the two clashed over script changes. McQueen wanted the other men’s roles diminished and his beefed up. McQueen got his way and Pirosh walked. The studio installed Don Siegel as director. McQueen’s antics had already alienated him from most of the cast, and he clashed with Siegel and the studio as production went on.

And yet, the film works. Its nihilistic tone stood in stark contrast to the heroic melodrama that dominated the genre. During one of the film’s most powerful scenes, a soldier screams “MY GUTS!” while clutching his stomach after being shot. The performance is gripping. The screams go on. Pain gives way to panic. Mania creeps into the soldier’s voice. It would be painful to watch if there were actual blood. But instead we’re given bloodless wounds and carnage-free explosions. 

To this end, the _Hell Is for Heroes_ feels more like a stage play than a full-fledged production. The sweltering northern California woods can only suggest the muddy forests of Germany. During battles, men stiffen up and fall over to simulate getting shot. Before the climatic battle, we’re shown low-quality stock footage of artillery firing.

But McQueen’s performance transcends the shoddy production. He doesn’t say much. Instead, he uses his eyes and body language to show us Reese’s feelings. It’s a riveting turn that’s equal parts cold detachment and tumultuous emotion. Watching the film, one is hard pressed to disagree with McQueen’s insistence that the script focus on him. He carries the film.

James Coburn also delivers a memorable turn as Henshaw, a habitual tinkerer who struggles with the madness of war. His defining scene sees him manning a flame-thrower, fighting back manic laughter as he incinerates trapped German soldiers. It’s a haunting vision that foreshadows the star Coburn would later become.

Granted, not all the performances are winners. Nick Adams overplays his part as a Polish refugee. His scenes bleed into melodrama. And Bob Newhart looks lost doing a variation of his standup shtick. But these are easy enough to overlook. In keeping with the film’s stage play aesthetic, Newhart’s bit plays like intermission.

According to multiple accounts, the film’s iconic ending was an accident. The production simply ran out of money and couldn’t shoot any more footage. Yet, it’s the perfect, morally ambiguous ending. The men charge forward as the camera zooms in. The war goes on, even as the film comes to an end, and we’re left to ponder the significance of a single pillbox and all the lives it cost.
