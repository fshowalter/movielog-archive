:pull_quote: _Hell Is for Heroes_ saw Steve McQueen piss off the cast, crew and studio, yet still make a good movie.

_Hell is for Heroes_ opens in France in the fall of 1944. A small squad of US soldiers is enjoying a much-needed break. Private John Reese, played by Steve McQueen arrives to join them. Reese is the stereotypical loner with a chip on his shoulder. A former master sergeant demoted down to private, Reese alienates himself from the rest of the men and disobeys orders by wandering down to the local tavern for a drink. While the rest of the squad are giddy over the rumors that they’ll soon be heading home, Reese is morose.

But, of course, the squad isn’t going home. Orders come through sending them back to the line. Reese brightens. Once the squad arrives, the existing American forces withdraw, leaving the squad outnumbered. The men rig up a series of schemes to project an illusion of strength, but the Germans soon learn the truth.

Reese believes their only chance is to attack a German pillbox across the line. This would force the Germans into a defensive position. The active officer orders Reese to stay put while he heads out to notify command. Reese convinces a couple of other soldiers to join him on a raid. Acting without orders, the men make their way across the mine-leaden no-man’s land with disastrous results.

Given the troubled production, the film should have been a mess. Robert Pirosh wrote the script and planned to produce and direct. Once McQueen came aboard, the two clashed over script changes. McQueen wanted the other men’s roles diminished and his beefed up. McQueen got his way and Pirosh walked. The studio installed Don Siegel as director. McQueen’s antics had already alienated him from most of the cast, and he clashed with Siegel and the studio as production went on.

And yet, the film works. When it’s working, it plays like a gritty, no-frills war picture. McQueen is great as a mentally scarred loner who you’d be hard pressed to like, but would want next to you in a foxhole. He doesn’t say much. Instead, McQueen uses his eyes and body language to show us what his character is feeling. It’s a riveting performance that carries the film.

The only other cast-member who comes close to registering opposite McQueen is a young James Coburn. Coburn plays Henshaaw, a habitual tinkerer who struggles with the madness of war. His defining scene comes during the sequences involving the German infiltration team. Manning a flame-thrower, he fights back manic laughter as he incinerates the German soldiers. It’s a haunting scene that foreshadows the star Coburn would later become.

It’s when the film veers from this gritty approach that it stumbles. Nick Adams overplays his part as a Polish refugee. His scenes bleed into melodrama. And Bob Newhart looks lost doing a variation of his standup shtick. Newhart at least, seems to have realized this and allegedly pestered Seigel to kill his character. Unfortunately, the studio wouldn’t hear of it.

The film also suffers from a low budget.  During one of the film’s most famous scenes, a soldier screams “MY GUTS!” while clutching his stomach after being shot. The performance is powerful. The screams go on. Pain gives way to panic. Mania creeps into the soldier’s voice. It would be painful to watch if there were actual blood. But instead we’re given bloodless wounds and carnage free explosions. 

In another cost-cutting move, low-quality, stock footage stock is spliced in during the film’s climactic battle.

Compared to these grievances, it’s easy to overlook how poorly the northern California woods substitute for the muddy forests of Germany.  

And yet, that same low budget, may be responsible for the film’s iconic ending. According to multiple accounts the production simply ran out of money and couldn’t shoot any more footage.

It’s the perfect ending. Abrupt and devoid of flair. The men charge forward as the camera zooms in. The war goes on, even if the film comes to an end, and we’re left to ponder the significance of a single pillbox and given all the lives it cost.
