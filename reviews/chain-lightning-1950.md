The skin-tight flight suit is a bridge too far.

Someone younger with a fuller build might have pulled it off. William Holden or Kirk Douglas, maybe. But at 49, the slender Bogart looks ridiculous.

The story opens during World War II. Bogart plays an enlisted pilot leading bombing runs and romancing a Red Cross worker played by Eleanor Parker. When orders send his squad home, Bogart and Parker try to marry. A series of contrivances thwarts their efforts and Bogart leaves.

Cut to present day. Stateside, more contrivances see a washed-up Bogart land a test pilot job for an aviation mogul played by Raymond Massey. Of course, Parker shows up as Massey’s secretary. She’s dating Massey’s chief engineer, played by Richard Whorf.

Conflict arises when Bogart suggests piloting Massey’s experimental fighter jet from Alaska to Washington, D.C.. It’s a stunt to convince the Washington brass the plane is ready for production. Whorf disagrees. He’s developing some new safety features, but needs time to test them. Massey wants to sell the fighter now. Bogart wants the money the stunt will net him so he can propose to Parker. As Bogart races to D.C., Whorf races to implement his new designs, using himself as a test pilot.

Besides Bogart, the only thing holding our interest is the script’s foresight. Though common enough today, escape pods, pressurized flight suits, and braking parachutes were science fiction to 1950’s audiences. But these bits are smothered by needless melodrama. Will Parker and Bogart get back together? Will there be obstacles to their romance? I think you know the answer.

The result feels like one of Bogart’s pre-_Casablanca (1942)_ pictures. Ones that saw him cast in whatever B-production Warners was shooting that week. Only this time he’s playing the iconic, cynical Bogart character instead of a generic heavy.

At one point Bogart pleads, “Hey, get me out of this Buck Rogers monkey suit, will ya?” He might have been talking about _Chain Lightning_ itself.
