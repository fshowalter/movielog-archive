Humphrey Bogart has a line in _Chain Lightning_ that could serve as a review: “Hey, get me out of this Buck Rogers monkey suit, will ya?”

The story opens with Bogart as an enlisted pilot leading bombing runs during World War II. He’s beloved by his men and respected by his commanding officer.

Between flights, he romances a Red Cross worker in London played by Eleanor Parker.

Then, orders come in sending Bogart’s squad home. Bogart and Parker try to marry, but a series of contrivances sees them run out of time. Bogart leaves.

Cut to present day. Back in the states, more contrivances see Bogart land a job as a test pilot for an aviation mogul played by Raymond Massey.

Of course, Parker is Massey’s secretary. She’s dating Massey’s chief engineer, played by Richard Whorf. Will she and Bogart get back together? Will there be obstacles to their romance? I think you know the answer.

Conflict arises when Bogart suggests piloting Massey’s experimental fighter jet from Alaska to Washington, D.C.. It’s a stunt to convince the Washington brass that the plane is safe for production. Whorf wants to add some new safety innovations he’s developing, but he needs time to test them. Massey wants to sell the current version now, and a safer version later. Bogart wants the money the stunt will net him.

As Bogart races to D.C., Whorf races to implement his new designs, using himself as a test pilot.

There’s a good story here, but it’s smothered by needless melodrama. Someone like Howard Hawks might have done the film justice. Stripped out the love triangle and focused on the drama inherit in developing and testing the next generation of aviation. Instead, the film feels like one of the early Warner pictures that saw Bogart cast in whatever B-production was shooting that week. Only this time he’s playing the iconic Bogart character instead of a generic heavy. It’s an ill-fit. His character’s not the star of the script, the jet fighter technology is.

The script foresaw many of the innovations coming to jet flight. Things like an escape pods, a pressurized flight suit, and braking parachutes, were science fiction to the film’s audience, but are common reality today. 

But about that flight suit.

For Bogart, it’s a bridge too far. Someone younger with a fuller build might have pulled it off. William Holden or Kirk Douglas, maybe. At 49, Bogart looks less like a jet pilot and more like a spaceman, such is the alien effect of seeing the aging, iconic actor in such a getup.

Now, dear reader, I realize my review may have left you more curious than dissuaded. That’s okay. For die-hard Bogart fans, _Chain Lightning_ is worth watching. Once.
