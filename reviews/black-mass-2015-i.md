It’s very good makeup, but I never saw a south Boston gangster. Just Johnny Depp.

Based on a true story, _Black Mass_ covers a fifteen-year period starting in 1975, as James “Whitey” Bulger ascends from small-time hood to crime-lord of south Boston.

Thanks in large part to the FBI. They give Bulger a sweet deal. He provides information on the Italian mob moving into North Boston, and in exchange the FBI leave him alone. Even better, they eliminate the competition. Best of all: the agent assigned to the case, John Connolly, played by Joel Edgerton, grew up in South Boston and views Bulger as something of a hero.

All the FBI ask is that Bulger not kill anyone.

But of course, Bulger kills people. He executes a member of his crew. His gang somehow gets involved in Jai Alai and Bulger orders the new commissioner killed. He strangles a young girl who may have said something to the cops.

This last murder was where the film lost me. It’s late in the film and the girl is introduced only for Bulger to kill her five minutes later. The scene plays like something out of a horror movie. Violence can be an effective tool to build characterization or advance the plot. This scene does neither.

We also meet Bulger’s younger brother, a state senator played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Cumberbatch is a good casting. His Boston accent may be jarring, but he’s believable as Depp’s brother. While both men seem too slight for their parts, they’re convincing as family.

The film invites comparisons with Scorsese’s _Goodfellas (1990)_ and _The Departed (2006)_. _Goodfellas_ via  Connolly’s slow-motion march of the Italian mobsters into custody. _The Departed_ by being set in South Boston. Such comparisons underline _Black Mass_’s weakness.

Despite spending two hours of screen time with him, we never get to know Bulger. We see him build his empire, but have no idea how he spends a typical day. We see him make piles of money but, aside from a pair of cowboy boots, we never see him spend it. While his crew parties in a Miami nightclub Bulger sits removed. His white skin and piercing blue eyes giving his face an undead hue in the darkness.

What motivates him? He’s faced with a tragedy and we’re told this changed him, yet his behavior seems no different. His mother dies and we’re told this changed him, but again, we don’t see it. Later, he becomes a patron of the IRA. We’re given no explanation aside from his being from South Boston.

By the end of the film we know much of what happened in Whitey Bulger’s life. But we know very little of why.
