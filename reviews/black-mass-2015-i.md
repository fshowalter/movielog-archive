Based on a true story, Black Mass follows James “Whitey” Bulger’s ascent from small-time hood to crime-lord of South Boston. A journey made possible by the FBI.

Early in the film, the Feds offer Bulger a sweet deal. In exchange for information on the Italian mob moving into North Boston, the FBI leave Bulger’s crew alone. Even better, they eliminate the competition. Best of all: Bulger’s FBI handler, John Connolly, played by Joel Edgerton, is a South Boston native who idolizes Bulger.

All the FBI ask is that Bulger not kill anyone.

But of course, Bulger kills people. He executes one of his lackeys. His gang somehow gets involved in Jai Alai and Bulger orders the new commissioner killed. He strangles a young girl who may have said something to the cops.

This last murder was where the film lost me. It’s late in the film and the girl is introduced only for Bulger to kill her five minutes later. The scene plays like something out of a horror movie and does nothing to build characterization or advance the plot.

We also meet Bulger’s younger brother, a state senator played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Cumberbatch is good casting. His Boston accent may be jarring, but he’s believable as Depp’s brother. While both men seem too slight for their parts, they’re convincing as family.

The film invites comparisons with Scorsese’s Goodfellas (1990) via Connolly’s slow-motion march of the Italian mobsters into custody and The Departed (2006) by being set in South Boston.

But these comparisons underscore Black Mass’s weakness: Bulger isn’t a compelling character. 

We see him build his empire, yet have no idea how he spends a typical day. He make piles of money but, aside from a pair of cowboy boots, we never see him spend it. After tragedies we’re told changed him, Bulger’s behavior seems no different. 

Depp tries as Bulger, but he can’t compensate for the shallow characterization. He can’t disappear into the character because there is no character, just makeup and an accent. 

With no insight into Bulger’s psyche, the film plays like a news report. By it’s end, we know much of what happened in Whitey Bulger’s life. But we know very little of why.
