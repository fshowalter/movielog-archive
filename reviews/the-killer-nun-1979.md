The killer nun is trash, but not pure trash, and that's a shame.

The premise is overflows with potential. Anita eckberg plays sister x, an icy, strict nun working at a hospital. Under her charge are various oddball characters, elderly twins, a livacious late middle age exerciser forever clad in a track suit, a young nun who looks at her with carnal devotion.

All is not well with sister x. She harbors a morphine addiction, and resorts to stealing to support it. In an excursion outside the hospital, she has sex with a stranger in a darkened hallway. She complains of intense headaches and begins treating her charges with increasing cruelty, including stomping an elderly woman's dentures to pieces. It all culminates with her instructing one of the other nuns to "say you're a dirty whore!"

Here's where the film goes wrong. Instead of sister x going full bonkers and offing the various patients, the film begins layering on plot. Y arrives as the new head physician. Patients do end up dead, but it's clear sister x isn't the murderer. There are a few more bits of outrageousness, but the film takes itself too seriously to give into its own ridiculousness.bas a result, things drag. The 85 minute running time feels closer to two hours.

As I've said before, I can forgive a lot in an exploitation picture. Bad acting, shabby effects, stilted dialog, no problem. But boredom? For a "nun-sploitation" picture, that's a cardinal sin.
