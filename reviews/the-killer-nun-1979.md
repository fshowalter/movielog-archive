_The Killer Nun_ is trash, but not pure trash, and that’s a shame.

The premise has potential. Anita Ekberg plays Sister Gertrude, the icy matron of a hospital overflowing with oddball characters. These include a pair of elderly twins, a lusty late-middle-age fitness buff, and Sister Matthieu, a young nun who eyes Sister Gertrude with carnal desire.

Early on, the script piles on the ridiculous. Sister Gertrude steals to support a morphine addiction she acquired while recovering from brain surgery. On an excursion outside the hospital, she has anonymous sex in a darkened hallway. Back at work, she complains of intense headaches and stomps an elderly patient’s dentures to pieces. Things reach an apex when a naked Sister Matthieu confesses her desires and Sister Gertrude orders her to “Say you’re a dirty whore!”

But instead of having Sister Gertrude go full-bonkers and off her assorted patients, the script gets talky. Sister Gertrude enacts a convoluted scheme to replace the head physician in a dead-end plot thread.

Worst of all, when the murders finally start, it’s clear Sister Gertrude isn’t the culprit. As a result, things drag while we wait for the characters to discover what we already know.

I can forgive much in an exploitation picture. Bad acting? Comes with the territory. Shabby effects? At least they tried. Stilted dialog? Good for a laugh. But boredom? For a “nunsploitation” picture, that’s a cardinal sin.
