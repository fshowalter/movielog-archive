_Black Legion_ should have been Humphrey Bogart’s breakout film. He delivers a fearless performance as Frank Taylor, a senior machinist and family man who’s in line for a rich promotion to foreman. To Frank’s shock, he’s passed over in favor of a younger coworker named Dombrowski from an immigrant family. Feeling angry and cheated, Frank falls in with the titular Legion, a black-robed hate group.

The Legion runs Dombrowski out of town and Frank ascends to foreman. Things are great until Frank’s Legion-mandated recruiting activities lead to an accident at the shop. When Frank finds himself demoted in favor of his neighbor, the Legion again come to Frank’s aid.

But the secrecy and violence take their toll. Frank drinks to excess. His wife leaves him, taking their young son with her. Frank takes up with the local floozy. One night, drunk and despondent, Frank confesses everything to his longtime friend Ed (Dick Foran). After sobering up, Frank panics and tells the Legion what he’s done. The Legion kidnap Ed, but things don’t go as planned, leaving Frank with blood on his hands and nowhere to turn.

_Black Legion_ shines with its insider’s view of the Legion’s operations. We see the radio demagogues cultivating resentment and fear. That fear drives Legion membership. New members buy mandatory uniforms and revolvers. Those proceeds fatten the wallets of small group of profiteers who fund the demagogues.

But while the script excels at following the money, it flounders with the melodrama. Having Frank go from honest family man to drunken womanizer in what seems like a matter of weeks feels disingenuous. Racism and hate don’t flatten you like a car wreck, they eat at you like a cancer. That’s what makes them so insidious. Making things so clear-cut undermines the still-relevant social context.
