Bogart plays Frank Taylor, a senior machinist and family man who's in line for a rich promotion to foreman. To Frank's shock, he's passed over in favor of a younger coworker named Dombrowski. Feeling angry and cheated, Frank falls in with the titular Legion, a black-robed hate group.

The Legion runs Dombrowski out of town and Frank ascends to foreman. Things are great until Frank's Legion-mandated recruiting activities lead to an accident at the shop. Frank is demoted in favor of his neighbor. Once again, the Legion come to Frank's aid.

The secrecy and violence begin to wear on Frank. He starts to drink heavily. His wife leaves him, taking their young son. Frank takes up with the local floozy. One night, drunk and despondent, Frank confesses everything to his longtime friend Ed (Dick Foran). After sobering up, Frank panics and tells the Legion what he's done. The Legion kidnap Ed, but things don't go as planned, leaving Frank with blood on his hands and nowhere to turn.

What separates _Black Legion_ from the typical melodrama is its depiction of how the Legion operates. We see the radio demagogues cultivating resentment and fear. We see how that fear drives Legion membership. We see the Legion members buying mandatory uniforms and revolvers. Finally, we see how those funds ends up in the hands of a small group of profiteers, who, in turn, fund the demagogues. In the end, it's all about money. 

But as good as the script is at pulling back the curtain of the Legion's operations, it flounders on the melodrama. Having Frank go from honest family man to drunken womanizer in what seems like a matter of weeks is disingenuous. Racism and hate don't flatten you like a car wreck, they eat at you like a cancer. That's what makes them so insidious and hard to root out. Making things so clear-cut only undermines the still-relevant social context.
