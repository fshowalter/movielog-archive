There's a scene in Stake Land where the bad guys attack the good guys by throwing vampires out of helicopters.

The story unfolds in a near-future where vamps (a kind of fast-running-zombie/vampire hybrid) have overrun the world. Enigmatic loner Mister takes in orphaned teen Martin. The pair head out in Mister's old Cadillac, searching for the fabled sanctuary of New Eden. Along the way, they run up against a neo-nazi militia using vamps as weapons of mass destruction.

After a grisly opening sequence where a vamp drains and discards the corpse of an infant, the film keeps its baddies off-screen as much as possible, relying on scenery to establish atmosphere. Deserted strip malls. Desolate two-lane blacktops. Overgrown buildings. Rusted scrapheaps. An urban wilderness. Until it's super-bloody third act, the film plays more like a western than horror.

There's a lot to like. The script respects the audience. When Martin hears his family is "already dead," he accepts it with wisdom seldom seen in horror films. And the production values and supporting performances belie it's all but straight-to-video release. And don't forget the part where the bad guys throw vampires out of helicopters.

But it's not without problems. The voiceover narration feels unnecessary. And I couldn't buy co-writer Nick Damici as Mister. His eyes betray his grizzled facade. Warren Oates would have been perfect, were he forty years younger and not dead.

Still, did I mention the bad guys throw vampires out of helicopters?
