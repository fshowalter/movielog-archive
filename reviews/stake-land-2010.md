_Stake Land_ is set in a near-future where vamps (a kind of fast-running-zombie/vampire hybrid) have overrun the world. Enigmatic loner Mister takes in orphaned teen Martin. The pair head out in Mister's old Cadillac, searching for the fabled land of New Eden. Along the way, they run up against a fundamentalist neo-nazi militia that uses vamps as weapons, dropping them out of helicopters into neighboring towns.

After a grisly opening sequence where a vamp drains and discards the corpse of an infant, _Stake Land_ keeps its baddies off-screen as much as possible. Instead, it's content to let the scenery establish atmosphere. Deserted strip malls. Desolate two-lane blacktops. Overgrown buildings. Rusted scrapheaps. An urban wilderness. It's more western than horror until the super-bloody third act.

But it's not perfect. The voiceover narration is unnecessary. And co-writer Nick Damici doesn't quite work as Mister. His eyes betray his grizzled facade. Warren Oates would have been perfect, were he forty years younger and not dead.

_Stake Land_ may not be a revelation, but it is a solid entry in the post-apocalyptic horror genre. The script respects the audience. When Martin hears that his family is "already dead," he accepts it with wisdom seldom seen in horror films. The production values and supporting performances belie the film's all but straight-to-video release. And come on, _the bad guys drop vampires out of helicopters_.
