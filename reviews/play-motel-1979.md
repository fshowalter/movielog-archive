I went in expecting a sleazy giallo and I got a sleazy giallo with a catchy folk-rock theme song.

As of this writing, the film's IMDb page has no trivia. No proof the American distributor already owned the song, changed the film's title, and spliced it into the soundtrack. None at all. So clearly, director Mario Gariazzo commissioned the theme, believing it a perfect tonal fit. If that's true, it might merit an extra star.

The film's plot concerns a blackmail scam photographing wealthy marks in compromising positions in the titular establishment. Said positions feature lots of nudity and kinky behavior.

Soon, a black-gloved killer starts picking off victims peripheral to the scam. After the killer stashes a body in a parked car's trunk, the cars owners, a young couple, get involved.

At the local police's urging, the couple turn amateur sleuths, a questionable decision that sees the wife pose node for a sleazy photographer while her husband waits in the car. When she's inevitably captured and beaten, he's laughably unconcerned.

This all plays out as an over-the-top cross between Scooby-Doo and softcore porn. The end reveal is laugh-out-loud implausible, and the blackmail scenes are as explicit as the censors would allow. It's pure exploitation in all it's ridiculous glory and I'll admit, it kept me entertained. If sleazy giallos are your thing, _Play Motel_ won't disappoint.
