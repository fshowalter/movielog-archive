&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not true. It&amp;#39;s about the bitter dissolution of a marriage. There are… &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; details, but we&amp;#39;ll get to them later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I shall attempt to convey a sense of the viewing experience. If you&amp;#39;ve seen the film, I can hear you laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening sequences assault you. Mark, played by Sam Neill, returns home to West Berlin and discovers his wife Anna, played by Isabelle Adjani, has checked out of their marriage. Neill and Adjani over-emote in performances ripped from a daytime soap opera. And yet, their scenes with their kindergarten-age son, Bob, feel restrained and true. The contrast holds your interest, as does the mystery of Mark&amp;#39;s job. The indirect way he talks to his employers and their responses hint at clandestine—even sinister—origins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the film marches on, the stakes rise. Mark moves out and spirals into an obsessive mania. When he visits some days later, Mark finds Bob alone and neglected. He moves back in and Anna disappears. In search of Anna, Mark confronts her new lover, gets bloodied, and returns home. There he discovers Anna, who won&amp;#39;t divulge where she&amp;#39;s been. Frustrated, Mark beats her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I&amp;#39;ve been cagey with the film&amp;#39;s plot points. What follows crosses into spoiler territory. Director Andrzej Żuławski&amp;#39;s film is a nihilistic Gordian knot of symbolism presented as psychological horror. It&amp;#39;s not that I&amp;#39;m not sure what the film is about; I&amp;#39;m not sure how the film is about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna has been disappearing to a derelict apartment where she copulates with a squid-like tentacled monster. This… &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; exhibits powerful psychic abilities, possessing the mind of anyone around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monster requires human flesh (or blood?) to grow, leading Anna to murder a series of interlopers, including her former lover, and a detective hired by Mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the bodies pile up, the film catches up to Neill and Adjani&amp;#39;s performances. Now their manic behavior feels appropriate. It&amp;#39;s a subtle trick I didn&amp;#39;t catch until my second viewing. Watching &lt;em&gt;Possession&lt;/em&gt; in a theater, the audience—full of wry snickers early on—sat riveted in silence by this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I haven&amp;#39;t mentioned Anna&amp;#39;s doppelgänger or the scene where Anna—oozing blood and slime from every orifice—miscarries the tentacle monster&amp;#39;s offspring in a deserted subway corridor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Żuławski saying? Between the talk of God and reoccurring shots of the Berlin Wall, &lt;em&gt;Possession&lt;/em&gt; remains a mystery. One that sticks with me for days. Is it the mix of nihilism and the supernatural? Perhaps. Regardless, though I may not know why it resonates, I can&amp;#39;t deny that it does.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: A-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>The Sister of Ursula (1978)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-sister-of-ursula-1978//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-sister-of-ursula-1978/</id><updated>2017-08-14</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-sister-of-ursula-1978/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/v20ZMN2WTkVQqGisREAy9879csTflVwhACGU211y0616Z0VZLWCyfo6mGFAj1KEbkzoaULhvqE_H-_sZjHvdVFlP1MIVX5dpdY9f6aQUG253POfiVc6Iyhp1frKAmbTNrWrbSoC86g=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part soft-core porn. Part giallo. All boring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sister of Ursula&lt;/em&gt; centers on two sisters, Dagmar and Ursula. As the film opens, they&amp;#39;re checking into a luxury hotel on the Italian coast. Ursula begs Dagmar to leave, claiming visions of a horrible future. With heavy sighs, Dagmar dismisses Ursula&amp;#39;s pleadings. Ursula pouts. Instead of establishing a forbidding atmosphere, the scene left me cold to Ursula&amp;#39;s petulant behavior. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dagmar convinces Ursula to accompany her to the hotel nightclub. There we meet the supporting players: the hotel manager, a sultry nightclub singer, and a pretty-boy gigolo. Dagmar feels a connection to the gigolo, but Ursula insists he&amp;#39;s dangerous. More sighs and dismissals from Dagmar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the film goes on, a pattern emerges. The script introduces either a character who has sex with a supporting player or a pair of characters who have sex with each other. A mysterious black-gloved figure watches the copulating couple from the shadows. After some late-night-cable-grade soft-core erotica, the black-gloved figure kills one or both of the lovers. Aside from a slashed throat, the violence occurs off-screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script offers few red herrings. Instead, it doles out assorted subplots including the sisters&amp;#39; search for their estranged mother, the hotel manager&amp;#39;s struggles with his estranged wife, and the gigolo&amp;#39;s drug habit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these threads held my interest. But the film&amp;#39;s reputation as a sleazy giallo had me certain it would veer into crazy territory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It proved a long wait. During the finale, after an unsurprising reveal of the killer&amp;#39;s identity, we see the murder weapon. Spoiler—it&amp;#39;s a giant phallus. Seeing the killer advance, phallus in hand, was just the sort of crazy I&amp;#39;d been expecting. But this scene doesn&amp;#39;t justify the hour-and-a-half investment. I&amp;#39;ve said it before, but it bears repeating. I can forgive a movie many things. Bad acting? Specious plotting? Gratuitous nudity? I can overlook them all. But I can&amp;#39;t forgive boring.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This marks my 101st review since relaunching this site in 2014. Prior to that, I strove to review every film I saw. Keeping pace with my movie-watching habit meant cranking out reviews at a relentless pace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the relaunch, I focused on quality over quantity. A good review describes the film and the experience watching it. As Roger Ebert said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, if it is a Pauly Shore comedy, there are people who like them, and they should be able to discover in your review if the new one is down to their usual standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the goal. A cursory look through my last 100 reviews reveals ample failures. Good writers show rather than tell. Too often, I present my opinion as fact instead of building a case for the reader to arrive at the same conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this line, from my review of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/malefique-2002/&quot;&gt;Maléfique (2002)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Carrère, Gérald Laroche provides a grounded audience surrogate whose gradual transformation into a bitter convict carries the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does that mean? How does it carry the film?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or this bit, from my review of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/breakfast-at-tiffanys-1961/&quot;&gt;Breakfast at Tiffany&amp;#39;s (1961)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patricia Neal plays the rich, married woman who pays Paul&amp;#39;s rent and keeps him in nice clothes. She makes an impression by underplaying her role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does she underplay the role?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or from my review of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/giallo-a-venezia-1979/&quot;&gt;Giallo a Venezia (1979)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The murders—particularly the prostitute&amp;#39;s—are uninspired and ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes them uninspired and ugly? I&amp;#39;m not describing the murders, I&amp;#39;m describing my reaction to them, but not calling that out as opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And consider the outright nonsense I&amp;#39;ve written, like the closing line from my review of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/interstellar-2014/&quot;&gt;Interstellar (2014)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interstellar doesn’t transcend the science fiction genre, it abandons it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lines like that make me wonder if I&amp;#39;m wasting my time. True, practice makes perfect, but practice requires feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen King writes for his wife. My wife provides great feedback but I have to petition her to read my work. She doesn&amp;#39;t like my style. I could take that as feedback in itself, but I&amp;#39;ve read reviews she &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; enjoy and &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;#39;t like them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried soliciting feedback via comments. The few replies I received spoke to my opinions, not the writing itself. Fair enough, considering the site&amp;#39;s homepage receives little traffic compared to the individual reviews. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s time I admit it: Constant Reader, you don&amp;#39;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why bother? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask myself that a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is my daughters. Neither is old enough to read, but they&amp;#39;re my audience. At least, their future selves. At my current pace, I&amp;#39;ll have written several hundred reviews by the time they&amp;#39;re old enough to watch R-rated movies. By the time they&amp;#39;re my age, statistics say I&amp;#39;ll be dead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which makes my failures as a writer all the more painful. But I still have time. Tomorrow&amp;#39;s rewrite can fix today&amp;#39;s shortfall. Provided I solve the feedback problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to &lt;em&gt;Rio Bravo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Wayne stars as John T. Chance, sheriff of Presidio County, Texas. He&amp;#39;s holding Joe Burdette for murder. Joe&amp;#39;s brother, Nathan, is a wealthy land baron. Nathan recruits a slew of mercenaries to free Joe. Chance&amp;#39;s allies consist of his drunken deputy Dude, played by Dean Martin, a crippled old curmudgeon named Stumpy, played by Walter Brennan, a young gunslinger named Colorado, played by Ricky Nelson, and a showgirl turned gambler named Feathers, played by Angie Dickinson. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script establishes the premise in the first ten minutes, with almost no dialog. From there, the film unfolds at a languid pace. There are flashes of action, but much of the film sees the cast sitting or standing around indoors, talking or reacting to one-another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is where I falter. I&amp;#39;m not sure why the film works so well. I can point to the charisma of Wayne and Martin, but that&amp;#39;s only part of it. The film speaks to something deeper. A good chunk of the film revolves around Chance rehabilitating Dude. Chance doesn&amp;#39;t coddle him, but it&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;tough love&amp;quot; either. Chance believes Dude will come around. For Dude, the desire to live up to that faith is stronger than any addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a wonderful male fantasy, and for two hours and change, we believe it. Chance is an idealized big-brother/father figure. He&amp;#39;s the strong, honest, capable, professional man we want to be. Dude is the flawed, vulnerable man we feel we are. Chance&amp;#39;s faith in Dude is Chance&amp;#39;s faith in us. Watching &lt;em&gt;Rio Bravo&lt;/em&gt; is a low-key cathartic experience. The most powerful scenes are wordless or book-ended with comic relief. It&amp;#39;s not a heavy film, but it punches above its weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And about the comic relief. Much of it comes via Walter Brennan&amp;#39;s character, but repeat viewings have lent a comedic shade to many of Wayne&amp;#39;s lines. Like Billy Wilder&amp;#39;s best films, &lt;em&gt;Rio Bravo&lt;/em&gt; uses comedy as a subtle distraction. When Chance says, &amp;quot;Sorry don&amp;#39;t get it done Dude,&amp;quot; we smirk at the delivery but feel the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m closing in on a thousand words and I haven&amp;#39;t touched on Angie Dickinson&amp;#39;s performance or Dimitri Tiomkin&amp;#39;s score. I could devote a couple hundred words to each and not do them justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one could write a book analyzing the film but I suspect only the author would enjoy it. &lt;em&gt;Rio Bravo&lt;/em&gt; taps into emotions it never acknowledges. We interpret the undercurrents based on our own experiences. Over-explaining things would force a singular interpretation and alienate the reader. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe I&amp;#39;m trying to justify my shortcomings as a writer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You tell me.

&lt;p&gt;The plot is vintage 80&amp;#39;s slasher. Years earlier, a small Nova Scotian mining town saw a cave-in trap several miners. The men on watch were AWOL at a Valentine&amp;#39;s Day party, forcing the lone survivor to resort to cannibalism. Following his rescue, the survivor donned his mining gear and murdered the negligent men. The town hasn&amp;#39;t celebrated Valentine&amp;#39;s Day since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash-forward. A fresh group of young miners and their girlfriends want to have a Valentine&amp;#39;s Day party. Unbeknownst to them, someone wearing a miner&amp;#39;s outfit has begun offing locals. The mayor and sheriff keep the killings under wraps and cancel the party. The frustrated miners move the party to the mine. Soon, the youngsters find themselves trapped underground with the killer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th (1980)&lt;/em&gt;, the story revolves around a tragedy of neglect born of indulgence. In a subtle nod, the film sets Valentine&amp;#39;s Day on a Saturday, making the preceding Friday the 13th. Like &lt;em&gt;Halloween (1978)&lt;/em&gt; it features a holiday theme. But &lt;em&gt;My Bloody Valentine&lt;/em&gt; eschews wooded cabins or suburban homes and substitutes a dank, dark, coal mine. It&amp;#39;s an inspired choice that works thanks to the location photography. Another inspired choice is the script&amp;#39;s allowance for multiple survivors. By avoiding the &amp;quot;final girl&amp;quot; trope, the film avoids the contrived plotting that goes into whittling a group, despite the natural human impulse to stick together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as an 80&amp;#39;s slasher, the only things working against the film are the Nova Scotian accents. To me, they sound too cheerful and polite, giving the film an unintentional satirical tone.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Harry in Your Pocket&lt;/em&gt;, James Coburn plays the titular Harry, a professional pick-pocket. He operates with Casey, an aging crook played by Walter Pidgeon. The plot follows a young couple who join Harry and Casey to form a wire mob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wire mob is an organized team of pick-pockets. Though we never learn the mechanics of pick-pocketing, we learn the lingo. A spotter directs stalls to distract the mark for the cannon who passes the poke to the drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gang travels from Seattle up to British Columbia then down to Salt Lake City. They board in the finest hotels and dine in the finest restaurants, their lifestyle financed by Harry via strangers&amp;#39; wallets. I appreciated the elegant way the film presented the bleak truth: what can Harry do with the money but spend it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, Coburn&amp;#39;s Harry proves an enigma. We learn little about him yet he remains relentlessly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, the film isn&amp;#39;t about Harry, it&amp;#39;s about Ray and Sandy, the young stalls who join Harry&amp;#39;s gang. Thanks to Trish Van Devere&amp;#39;s performance, I could buy Sandy as a detached thrill seeker, but Michael Sarrazin&amp;#39;s performance as Ray left me impatient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devoid of any edge, Sarrazin plays Ray as a generic nice guy who&amp;#39;d prefer a 9-to-5 job and a house in the suburbs. When Ray&amp;#39;s alone on screen, the film drags. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I liked the movie. Chalk it up to Coburn. He&amp;#39;s so interesting to watch, he makes mediocre movies good, and good movies great. &lt;em&gt;Harry in Your Pocket&lt;/em&gt; is closer to mediocre, but Coburn makes it worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It opens with eccentric inventor Clyde Wynant preparing to go into seclusion to work on a new project. He&amp;#39;s interrupted by a visit from his daughter Dorothy who announces her engagement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wynant hurries Dorothy out but promises to return in time for her wedding. Wynant continues his preparations but finds the $50,000 in bonds he&amp;#39;d earmarked as a wedding present to Dorothy have gone missing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wynant storms over to his mistress Julia&amp;#39;s apartment and catches her in another man&amp;#39;s arms. Wynant accuses Julia of stealing the bonds and threatens to turn her over to the police. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three months later, Dorothy hasn&amp;#39;t heard from her father. While out at a restaurant, she recognizes former detective Nick Charles, played by William Powell, and approaches him for help. Nick declines, citing his new life of leisure with his heiress wife Nora, played by Myrna Loy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when circumstances pin a pair of murders on the still missing Wynant, Nick steps in, uncovering a buried skeleton and a labyrinthine array of suspects and motives. The mystery culminates with New York&amp;#39;s finest corralling everyone to a dinner party where Nick reveals the true killer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talky opening betrays the film&amp;#39;s B-movie production. It&amp;#39;s a stiff ten minutes but don&amp;#39;t worry. Once Powell makes his appearance—in a posh bar showing an impromptu crowd how various cocktails demand unique shaking rhythms (Manhattans a Fox-Trot, Bronxs a Two-Step, and Dry Martinis a Waltz)—everything changes. The dialog shifts from stilted exposition to witty banter as Powell glides through the film as the witty urbane charmer we believe ourselves to be after a few drinks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script offers little real danger and the entire plot proves little more than a MacGuffin to support his lyrical banter, which reaches its apex during the iconic dinner party scene. As Nora says, “It&amp;#39;s the best dinner I&amp;#39;ve ever listened to.”&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After chewing him out for being a drunken womanizer, Wallace&amp;#39;s father puts him to work collecting a debt owed by a minister. Wallace falls for the minister&amp;#39;s daughter, Marion, played by top-billed Evelyn Knapp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film&amp;#39;s first half sees Wallace pursue Marion. The two marry, which causes a rift between Wallace and his father, who views Marion as a gold digger despite never meeting her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marion goes to the elder Wallace to smooth things over, but a mix-up lands her hired as his secretary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early scenes with John Wayne as a drunken playboy checking out women&amp;#39;s ankles in his rearview mirror had me laughing. They&amp;#39;re almost enough to recommend the film. But the lack of chemistry between Wayne and Knapp, and the awkward third-act plotting, reserve &lt;em&gt;His Private Secretary&lt;/em&gt; for Wayne die-hards only.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months back, I gave &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/island-of-death-1977/&quot;&gt;Island of Death (1977)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; a four-star review, praising its “everything-but-the-kitchen sink approach that pushes the film past any genuine scares or mean-spirited umbrage, and firmly into parody.” &lt;em&gt;Giallo a Venezia&lt;/em&gt; opens with a similar vibe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We meet an improbably coiffed police detective inspecting the murder of a married couple, Fabio and Flavia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the case unwinds, we learn Fabio was a sex fiend. In a series of flashbacks, he pushes Flavia to engage in escalating deviant behavior. First simple voyeurism, but soon he&amp;#39;s whipping her, encouraging strangers to grope her, and her to grope strangers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whipping bit had me laughing. The scene starts with Fabio and Flavia in bed. She tries to engage him, kissing and fondling him, but he&amp;#39;s bored and soon retires to another room where he thumbs through a book of erotic drawings. Still looking at the drawings, Fabio snorts a sizable amount of cocaine. The combination enacts a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transformation that sees him return to Flavia, cat-o-nine-tails in hand, and wail on her. She screams which only excites him further, and soon he&amp;#39;s forcing himself into an uncomfortable place. Played straight, the scene would be painful, but it&amp;#39;s so over-the-top, it&amp;#39;s hard to take seriously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But instead of embracing the ridiculous, the film doubles down on misogyny. A mysterious killer offs a prostitute and some friends of Fabio and Flavia. The murders—particularly the prostitute&amp;#39;s—are uninspired and ugly. The film gets progressively meaner, culminating in a gang-rape scene I found hard to watch. &lt;em&gt;Giallo a Venezia&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#39;t crazy enough to entertain and lacks any thoughts to provoke. It&amp;#39;s just rubbing our noses in a series of obnoxious scenes it believes pass for edgy drama.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>The Ghoul (1933)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-ghoul-1933//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-ghoul-1933/</id><updated>2017-06-12</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-ghoul-1933/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GfPDGVCpp5mYVL-WLq7e-qfMaTu91UxP_P-hRwLuSZmUSVmm84Xz-scVA37pgP27Bzv5JqMwleVYv0wrDZqC3E75U5MARmam4iD0rJZMIrG7hMVAgtHH7T4uTN5Nl0BjKI2rXA=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the most ardent Boris Karloff fan can skip &lt;em&gt;The Ghoul&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a bait and switch. The opening sees Karloff playing an ailing, disfigured Egyptologist. Bedridden in a gloomy mansion, he details the conditions for his entombment following his imminent death. It&amp;#39;s a good setup, and the funeral scene that follows has us pumped for some undead action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these scenes appear tacked on to capitalize on Karloff&amp;#39;s prior box office successes: &lt;em&gt;The Mummy (1932)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Old Dark House (1932)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the title, &lt;em&gt;The Ghoul&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#39;t a horror film. With Karloff off-screen, the film devolves into a tedious mystery. A slew of characters turn up searching for a rare jewel stolen from Karloff&amp;#39;s tomb. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the supporting cast&amp;#39;s flat delivery and stiff dialog, following the convoluted plot proves an ordeal. The overbearing score doesn&amp;#39;t help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, the cobwebbed sets and shadowy photography create a rich gothic atmosphere, but the film fails to exploit it. When Karloff finally returns for the film&amp;#39;s final third as the titular ghoul, he&amp;#39;s far from terrifying. Creeping around like a dim-witted zombie, he seems as bored as we are.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my senior year of high school, I worked at Suncoast Video. It wasn&amp;#39;t a rental store, but one that sold VHS and Laserdisc movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On monitors mounted throughout the store we&amp;#39;d show whatever clamshelled, family-friendly title corporate was pushing—think &lt;em&gt;Free Willy (1993)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the holiday season, corporate would ship washing-machine-sized boxes of product for us to stock. Nothing stayed in the back room so we&amp;#39;d be there—well past midnight—stacking copies of &lt;em&gt;The Bodyguard (1992)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sister Act (1992)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we worked, we&amp;#39;d put on a movie. The monitors would be off, but we&amp;#39;d listen. &lt;em&gt;Casablanca&lt;/em&gt; proved an employee favorite on those long nights. Though I&amp;#39;d never seen it, I loved the crackling dialog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca and the Germans have outlawed miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story takes place during World War II. Casablanca, an unoccupied French colony, has become a purgatory for European refugees looking to escape to America. We meet Rick, an American expatriate played by Humphrey Bogart. He runs the most popular cafe in town. As Louis, the venal Prefect of Police played by Claude Rains says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody comes to Rick&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Rick&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re entertained by Sam, a piano playing singer played by Dooley Wilson. Aside from Sam and the cafe, Rick maintains a cool detachment from everything and everyone. That changes once long-lost flame Ilsa (played by Ingrid Bergman) walks in on the arm of Victor Lazlo, a resistance leader wanted by the Germans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing Ilsa shakes Rick from his isolationist stance, and soon he&amp;#39;s abetting the local resistance. The Germans retaliate by insisting Louis shut down the cafe. Amid the chaos of the police chasing everyone out, Rick demands an explanation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOUIS&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;#39;m shocked, SHOCKED, to find gambling going on here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(A croupier approaches with a large wad of cash)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CROUPIER&lt;br&gt;
Your winnings sir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOUIS&lt;br&gt;
Oh, thank you, very much!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not just funny, it&amp;#39;s Billy Wilder funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the film pivots with ease. Grounded in relatable emotions, the melodrama packs a punch. Consider how Rick spits venom at Ilsa:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess neither one of our stories is very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Lazlo, or were there others in between or… aren&amp;#39;t you the kind that tells?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No weepy speeches, just relatable emotion setup by an earlier scene between a drunken Rick and Sam:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAM&lt;br&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s get outta here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RICK&lt;br&gt;
No Sam, I&amp;#39;m waiting for a lady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAM&lt;br&gt;
Please boss, let&amp;#39;s go. Ain&amp;#39;t nothing but trouble for you here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RICK (staring at the liquor in front of him)&lt;br&gt;
She&amp;#39;s coming back. I know she&amp;#39;s coming back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAM&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;#39;ll take the car. We&amp;#39;ll drive all night. We&amp;#39;ll get drunk. We&amp;#39;ll go fishing and stay away until she&amp;#39;s gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RICK (not looking at Sam)&lt;br&gt;
Shut up and go home, will ya?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAM&lt;br&gt;
No sir, I&amp;#39;m staying right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great lines abound but some of the film&amp;#39;s best moments are visual. I didn&amp;#39;t discover them until years later, when I finally sat down and watched the film. Nice touches like when the waiter checks his pockets after the pickpocket bumps him. Or the beat-perfect editing between Rick and Louis during the finale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let&amp;#39;s talk about that ending. It&amp;#39;s not a happy one. Rick sends the love of his life away and goes off to a likely death. Noble? Absolutely. But in an era where studios were allergic to unhappy endings, it&amp;#39;s amazing this one went over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, it&amp;#39;s impressive how the script doesn&amp;#39;t have Ilsa waffle, even when she believes Rick has betrayed Victor. This casts her in an unflattering light, but gives the ending its resonance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a movie buff before &lt;em&gt;Casablanca&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#39;s what got me the video store job. But &lt;em&gt;Casablanca&lt;/em&gt; made me a Bogart fan, which led me to &lt;em&gt;The Big Sleep (1946)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Maltese Falcon (1941)&lt;/em&gt;, which led me to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-thin-man-1934/&quot;&gt;The Thin Man (1934)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, along with the films of John Huston and Howard Hawks, which led me to the films of William Powell and John Wayne, which led me to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/rio-bravo-1959/&quot;&gt;Rio Bravo (1959)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and well… you get the idea. &lt;em&gt;Casablanca&lt;/em&gt; changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m not alone. Roger Ebert considered &lt;em&gt;Casablanca&lt;/em&gt; his favorite movie. What higher recommendation can I offer?&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: A+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film opens during the final moments of &lt;em&gt;Man of Steel (2013)&lt;/em&gt;. We follow Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne rushing through the chaotic streets of Metropolis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overhead, Superman battles Zod—a Kryptonian bent on wiping out humanity. The two aliens crash through buildings and unleash arcs of laser-like heat vision. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Bruce approaches Wayne Enterprises&amp;#39; Metropolis office, Superman and Zod rip through the building like a bullet. The skyscraper topples, sending out a massive cloud of debris. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People scream. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emergency responders freeze. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruce Wayne runs toward the destruction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the dust clears, Bruce snatches little girl from the path of some falling debris. He crouches down and looks in her wide eyes. “It&amp;#39;s going to be okay,” he says. “We&amp;#39;re going to find your mom. Where is she? Where&amp;#39;s your mom?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girl points—her arm shaking—toward the smoldering rubble of the Wayne tower. Bruce pulls the girl close and glares up—eyes full of rage—at Superman and Zod still zooming through the air. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that shot, any apprehension I had about Affleck evaporated. He&amp;#39;s not wearing the suit, but he&amp;#39;s Batman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this sequence&amp;#39;s accomplishments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It summarizes and even provides the payoff for the excessive destruction sequences of the prior film. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sells Affleck in the role of Batman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It establishes motivation for the conflict between the titular characters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this with near-constant action and no exposition. It&amp;#39;s an amazing sequence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it also commits the film&amp;#39;s most egregious sin: it raises our expectations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, the film devolves into a mess of dead-end plot threads and superfluous characters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some had potential. Holly Hunter plays a US Senator chairing a hearing discussing Superman&amp;#39;s unchecked role in global affairs. We&amp;#39;re given an iconic image of Superman hovering outside the Capitol building, before symbolically landing and walking inside. What followed should have been crackling, character-driven drama. Instead, the building blows up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This explosion comes courtesy of Lex Luthor, played by Jessie Eisenberg as an eccentric young industrialist. He blows up the Capitol because—well, mostly because the script feels stitched together. Luthor manipulates Superman and Batman into fighting one another because—well, see above. Luthor also creates a giant monster because… well, you get the idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other characters and scenes exist solely to set up the next films in the franchise. We meet Wonder Woman. She&amp;#39;s superfluous to the story, but proves a compelling character, largely because she&amp;#39;s devoid of angst. We also get awkward teases for Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there&amp;#39;s so much going on, I can&amp;#39;t imagine someone following it all without having read the comics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How else to recognize the small, but important bits of characterization? Like how Joker&amp;#39;s murdering Robin lead to this film&amp;#39;s more brutal Batman. Or bigger bits, like uber-villain Darkseid&amp;#39;s Omega sigil in Bruce&amp;#39;s apocalyptic vision and how Luthor&amp;#39;s ramblings in the finale reference Darkseid&amp;#39;s mother box technology. Reading between the lines, Luthor was little more than Renfield to Darkseid&amp;#39;s Dracula. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But relying on the viewer&amp;#39;s prior exposure to the characters invites preconceived notions of who these characters should be. And I can&amp;#39;t imagine anyone familiar with the Superman mythos getting behind this version of Luthor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we haven&amp;#39;t even covered the inanity of a script that sees Batman murder criminals and cause the same wanton destruction that so enraged him during the film&amp;#39;s opening sequence. Consider Batman, in his plane, leading a monster back to the city so he can retrieve a weapon that might kill it. Why not fly back, grab the weapon, then battle the monster in relative isolation? Because the movie isn&amp;#39;t interested in making sense. It&amp;#39;s too busy trying to build a franchise.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>Play Motel (1979)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/play-motel-1979//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/play-motel-1979/</id><updated>2017-05-22</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/play-motel-1979/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2ZyuabwsHwnSKAPR5yy1dOkft_OvODMZfgoDsMXDjALPMdzDJQsvw3S-slLMIMsZvcVYzSmMXhIkRH7QX-fAAa1xPohbDESRzKMNFrBlqGAjUX5JywHuzR0ef_JSJU_eh8ahEw=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expected a sleazy giallo and I got a sleazy giallo. The catchy folk-rock theme song? That surprised me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, the film&amp;#39;s IMDb page has no trivia. No proof the American distributor already owned the song, spliced it into the soundtrack, and changed the film&amp;#39;s title. Nope, none at all. So, clearly, director Mario Gariazzo commissioned the theme, believing it a perfect tonal fit. If that&amp;#39;s true, it might merit an extra star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film&amp;#39;s plot concerns a blackmail scam photographing wealthy marks in compromising positions in the titular establishment. Said positions feature lots of nudity and kinky behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, a black-gloved killer starts picking off victims peripheral to the scam. After the killer stashes a body in a parked car&amp;#39;s trunk, the car&amp;#39;s owners, a young couple, get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the local police&amp;#39;s urging, the couple turns amateur sleuths, a questionable decision that sees the wife pose nude for a sleazy photographer while her husband waits in the car. When she&amp;#39;s inevitably captured and beaten, he&amp;#39;s laughably unconcerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all plays out as an over-the-top cross between Scooby-Doo and softcore porn. The end reveal is laugh-out-loud implausible, and the blackmail scenes are as explicit as the censors would allow. It&amp;#39;s pure exploitation in all it&amp;#39;s ridiculous glory and I&amp;#39;ll admit, it kept me entertained. If sleazy giallos are your thing, &lt;em&gt;Play Motel&lt;/em&gt; won&amp;#39;t disappoint.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My heels rise. The balls of my feet press into the floor. My hands clench tight and I realize I&amp;#39;m holding my breath. &lt;em&gt;Heat&lt;/em&gt; on the big screen is an experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen the film several times, yet the centerpiece shootout scene in the streets of downtown Los Angeles always elicits a visceral reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boiled down, it&amp;#39;s a cops and robbers story. Robert De Niro leads a crew of professional thieves taking down a series of Los Angeles scores. Al Pacino leads the cops in pursuit. They&amp;#39;re archetypes in the Howard Hawks tradition—professions personified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, &lt;em&gt;Heat&lt;/em&gt; feels like a Hawks picture, right down to the underwritten female characters. But while Hawks romanticized the professional, &lt;em&gt;Heat&lt;/em&gt; shows us the cost of such a lifestyle. De Niro plans the heists with military precision, yet lives alone in a palatial seaside estate that could pass for vacant. Pacino hunts De Niro&amp;#39;s crew with obsessive fervor, even as his third marriage crumbles around him. Both performances feel larger than life yet intensely human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to the shootout. It makes the movie. The scene carries an immense gravitas because everything about it feels authentic. From the way the characters fire short bursts and reload, to their tactical movements, it all resonates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not to say writer/director Michael Mann values authenticity over drama. His kinetic editing includes plenty of long and wide shots to establish movement and geography, immersing us in the scene. We don&amp;#39;t witness the gunfight we &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: A+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>Free Fire (2016)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/free-fire-2016//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/free-fire-2016/</id><updated>2017-05-08</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/free-fire-2016/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gCIe14X_ycptKUtFPj1mRS479ZGy7emqLvc1_gve1Ik48XW0eucK0GhxLoc0LRUPFroQJe07nOmcBn3iVvKGsadZgwnf6UERV_sFFH10vKNcPEQUH8ZYPRgXF8NPGgkbN5TFIw=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know that scene in crime movies, where a back-alley deal turns sour, resulting in a shootout? &lt;em&gt;Free Fire&lt;/em&gt; stretches that into an entire movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in 1978 Boston, the plot sees Cillian Murphy and Michael Smiley play IRA gang leaders buying guns from gang leaders played by Sharlto Copley and Armie Hammer. Brie Larson plays the intermediary. As the deal goes down, a grunt in one gang squabbles with a grunt the other gang, escalating into a full-fledged melee. Amid the flying bullets, the script weaves in some double-crosses. But honestly? The details escape me. &lt;em&gt;Free Fire&lt;/em&gt; isn’t concerned with plot, but style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s got style to spare. The clothes, the hair, the set decoration—this movie does the impossible: it makes 1978 look cool. Do they give Academy Awards for that? They should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as much as I enjoyed the film’s look, the execution frustrated me. When the firefight breaks out, director Ben Wheatley offers no sense of geography. Folks shoot and scramble for cover but we have no sense of their placement in relation to one another. A few wide shots would have sufficed. Disorient characters, not the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it almost doesn’t matter. The dialog held my ear, and despite little plot or characterization, the cast—particularly Hammer—grabbed my attention through sheer charisma. &lt;em&gt;Free Fire&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a good movie, but it’s as good an okay movie as you’ll find.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raw&lt;/em&gt; stars Garance Marillier as Justine, a young woman entering veterinarian college. On her first night, a hazing ritual sees masked men invade the dorms and force the freshmen to march and crawl—half dressed—across the campus. I couldn’t believe how the students reacted. No one asserted themselves or fought back. Maybe it’s a cultural thing (it’s a French film) but the herd imagery felt too pointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot kicks in when another hazing ritual forces Justine—a lifelong vegetarian—to try meat. This first taste unlocks an insatiable craving for human flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the surface, &lt;em&gt;Raw&lt;/em&gt; is about Justine discovering and battling her cannibalistic urges. But writer/director Julia Ducournau positions cannibalism as a metaphor for escaping overbearing parents, discovering one’s sexuality, defending animal rights, and struggling to escape an older sibling’s shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juggling so many metaphors leaves little time for subtlety. It’s frustrating. Several scenes made me uncomfortable but said discomfort felt manipulative and obnoxious. Other scenes fall apart upon reflection. Some scenes do both. The night following her first taste of meat, Justine awakens covered in huge itchy welts with swaths of her skin peeling off in dry sheets. She yawns and goes back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, &lt;em&gt;Raw&lt;/em&gt; has its strengths. The cinematography grabbed my attention from the opening shot, and the performances convince to the degree the script allows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I just couldn’t buy it. For a film desperate to frame its genre elements as a serious conceit, too many details strained credibility. Justine as a cannibal? Sure. But a campus full of kids not glued to their smartphones? Preposterous.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, not exactly, but &lt;em&gt;Deadpool&lt;/em&gt; works because it takes its source material seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan Reynolds stars as Wade Wilson a former special forces operative turned mercenary with a heart of gold. Just as he meets the girl of his dreams and finds the happiness that&amp;#39;s eluded him all his life, Wade learns he&amp;#39;s developed terminal cancer. A mysterious organization reaches out with the promise of a cure. Wade accepts, but the cure carries at a steep price. Presumed dead, Wade embarks on a mission of vengeance, complete with running color commentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadpool&lt;/em&gt; plays as a self-aware comic book film. The first time I watched it, I laughed so hard I missed most of the jokes. Besides the non-stop non-sequiturs, we get jokes about the plot, jokes about the other &lt;em&gt;X-Men&lt;/em&gt; films, and jokes about the limited budget. They&amp;#39;re not belittling the genre, just mining it for laughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And these laughs come wrapped in a solid origin story. The film invests time in Wade and his relationships, making him more than a clown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the credit goes to Reynolds. His deadpan comedy proves the perfect match for the character&amp;#39;s gallows humor. He doesn&amp;#39;t just carry the film, he propels it along with his considerable charisma. This despite having essentially a voice-over role for most of his scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s said one can mark a genre&amp;#39;s end when it devolves into comedy, as &lt;em&gt;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948)&lt;/em&gt; ended the Universal Monster era. But that needn&amp;#39;t be the case. Rather than transplant genre characters into a comedic film, &lt;em&gt;Deadpool&lt;/em&gt; takes a genre film and adds liberal doses of comedy. It&amp;#39;s a subtle but important distinction. &lt;em&gt;Deadpool&lt;/em&gt; may be hilarious, but it&amp;#39;s a comic book movie first, and a comedy second.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>Shock (1946)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/shock-1946//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/shock-1946/</id><updated>2017-04-17</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/shock-1946/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6goXr9YlP7Fo6zg1X2R9Eabmn-iXHhtD_SzG8_NS529ejrdyrMOsr-84JqJD27uXP0AdxK7UX193n22YMpKuEEs6byE7ZARY8QQYfgGC04y3opLJEHFuTEP60qYCo1d4mJhJMQ=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#39;t believe me when I tell you not to watch &lt;em&gt;Shock&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially if you&amp;#39;re a Vincent Price fan. The plot alone will convince you it&amp;#39;s worth watching. Price plays a psychiatrist who murders his wife. Unbeknownst to him, Anabel Shaw&amp;#39;s character witnesses the murder from her hotel room. The sight renders her catatonic and she falls under the care of—you guessed it—Price&amp;#39;s character. Better still: Shaw&amp;#39;s character spies the murder only after waking from an anxiety-laden nightmare, calling into question her reliability as a narrator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could play as a cross between &lt;em&gt;Rebecca (1940)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Suspicion (1941)&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, it plays like &lt;em&gt;Double Indemnity (1944)&lt;/em&gt;. There&amp;#39;s no doubt Price&amp;#39;s character is guilty. He&amp;#39;s egged on by femme fatale Lynn Bari.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can hear you saying to yourself, “That sounds interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m here to tell you, it isn&amp;#39;t. Price doesn&amp;#39;t register as charming or sinister. He has zero chemistry with Bari, who herself fails to register as seductive or cunning. This renders the entire film rather boring, which as I&amp;#39;ve written before, is a film&amp;#39;s most unforgivable sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s face it: if you&amp;#39;re a Vincent Price fan, you won&amp;#39;t believe me. Price played this sort of role so well in so many later pictures, you can&amp;#39;t fathom him falling flat. To those fans, I offer this condolence: if you make it through the film, you&amp;#39;ll see the ending, which I found so unintentionally funny I laughed aloud. So that&amp;#39;s something.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His performance channels a young William Holden or Steve McQueen. Sure, seeing colonel John &amp;quot;Hannibal&amp;quot; Smith play a romantic lead will shock those of a certain age, but the jolt is short-lived. Peppard pulls off the role with aplomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts with his clothes. Okay—not really, but I love his wardrobe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peppard plays Paul, a writer posing as a gigolo or vice versa. As the film opens, he&amp;#39;s moving into a converted New York brownstone apartment. There he meets Holly Golightly, a quirky socialite played by Hepburn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He falls for her. She for him. Complications ensue. What makes &lt;em&gt;Breakfast at Tiffany&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; special is not the plot, but the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul and Holly are both damaged people, skirting responsibility and commitment with a fear bordering on phobic. When Paul meets Holly he&amp;#39;s drawn by her fragile nature. The diminutive Hepburn looks the part. Paul longs to swoop in and save Holly. Unlike her other suitors, Paul&amp;#39;s in no position to save anyone, he&amp;#39;s just as wounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patricia Neal plays the rich, married woman who pays Paul&amp;#39;s rent and keeps him in nice clothes. She makes an impression by underplaying her role. As does Buddy Ebsen as a lovesick figure from Holly&amp;#39;s shadowy past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s this willingness to embrace flawed characters—and not flawed in cute ways, but morally suspect ones—that makes &lt;em&gt;Breakfast at Tiffany&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, we get plenty of soft focus close-ups, Mickey Rooney as a racist caricature meant as comic relief, and a finale set in a rainy, yet well-lit alley, but &lt;em&gt;Breakfast at Tiffany&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; transcends the tropes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest complaint lies with the ending. Holly isn&amp;#39;t a real person, she&amp;#39;s a ghost, drifting in and out of people&amp;#39;s lives, leaving an indelible impression. That Paul could end up with her doesn&amp;#39;t ring true. She&amp;#39;s not the girl you marry, she&amp;#39;s the girl you wonder about years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it&amp;#39;s a great film and Hepburn deserves the kudos showered upon her performance. But it works because Peppard wins us over too.&lt;/p&gt;

</content></entry><entry><title>Logan (2017)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/logan-2017//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/logan-2017/</id><updated>2017-04-03</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/logan-2017/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/i8MoyM90ZwROOXuzUTOhkM9j9rsS3uGF73dVSqV67PHqw9U7jGEqPArKCYUoBBvT-S7EeKGAWlQuRvLEvxwgPd59o0_4ATGGGjxHYmVF4rKoIQA1rz7ydczdlk4RvMuOQQdxYQ=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s taken 17 years, but &lt;em&gt;Logan&lt;/em&gt; gives us the Wolverine we&amp;#39;ve always wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugh Jackman reprises the titular role for what he claims is the final time. Given the film&amp;#39;s box office success, I consider his retirement suspect, but I digress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film opens with Logan jarred from a drunken stupor in the back seat of a car. He stumbles out to discover a gang of young thieves attempting to strip the car. He pleas for them to stop and the thieves shoot him without a moment&amp;#39;s hesitation. He drops to the ground, apparently dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A beat passes and Logan struggles to his feet. The thieves turn, surprised. Once again, Logan appeals to reason. Again, the thieves shoot him. Logan&amp;#39;s temper snaps, he lets loose a slew of obscenities and winces in anger as he unsheathes his claws. The thieves&amp;#39; eyes go wide with terror as Logan snarls and charges forward, dismembering the punks in a bloody burst of violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This film earns its R-rating but doesn&amp;#39;t wallow in it. The violence feels gritty but not gratuitous. This is Wolverine uncensored, ripped from the comics and thrust into the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, almost. The time, we learn, is the near-future. The place is the southern US. Logan earns a low-profile living driving a limousine. He spends his meager earnings bribing hospital staff for the medication he administers to Charles Xavier, played once again by Patrick Stewart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forced into hiding, Logan and Xavier are all that remain of the X-Men. Xavier&amp;#39;s succumbing to dementia, rendering his mind a potential weapon of mass destruction. Logan&amp;#39;s mutant healing ability is fading and the adamantium lacing his bones is slowly poisoning him. Facing mortality and struggling to make ends meet, they are comic book heroes made human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, almost. The plot kicks in when Logan discovers he has a daughter who&amp;#39;s being hunted by a military-industrial conglomerate. As much as the film yearns to transcend the comic book genre, we get a cybernetic head bad guy, an evil Wolverine clone, and some magic healing juice that exists to facilitate the third act. These aren&amp;#39;t deal-breakers, but they weaken the film&amp;#39;s impact. With so much nonsense it&amp;#39;s hard to take the serious parts, well, seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I enjoyed &lt;em&gt;Logan&lt;/em&gt;, if for nothing more than Jackman and Stewart&amp;#39;s performances. They make their characters feel familiar yet fresh and appear to relish the unidealized roles. That said, as the film unwound, I kept hoping Ian McKellen would turn up as Magneto. His scenes with Stewart were among the highlights of &lt;em&gt;X-Men (2000)&lt;/em&gt;, and he deserves an encore. Hey, maybe reconsider that retirement, Hugh?&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What We Do in the Shadows&lt;/em&gt; is a mockumentary following four vampires sharing a house in Wellington, New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film works best when it satirizes reality TV and focuses on the minutia of household life. The vampires bicker over household chores, dress for a night out, and prepare dinner for their would-be victims. In these moments, the film shines. Watching them struggle to dress up without mirrors had me roaring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a genre fan, I liked how the film satirized multiple cinematic vampire incarnations. Everything from &lt;em&gt;Nosferatu (1922)&lt;/em&gt; through &lt;em&gt;Twilight (2008)&lt;/em&gt;. The interplay between these incarnations offers some of the film&amp;#39;s best laughs. There&amp;#39;s also a group of werewolves, lead by Rhys Darby in a scene-stealing performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also enjoyed the film&amp;#39;s willingness to embrace the gore. One horrific yet hilarious scene involves a vampire trying and failing to devour a victim without spraying blood all over an antique couch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But about the length. Even at just 86 minutes, the film drags. The forced plot provides little emotional or comedic payoff and feels like dead weight. If reality TV can do without plot, why can&amp;#39;t the film that skewers it? Given how much the film gets right, it&amp;#39;s a petty quibble, but one that keeps &lt;em&gt;What We Do in the Shadows&lt;/em&gt; shy of perfection.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>Get Out (2017)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/get-out-2017//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/get-out-2017/</id><updated>2017-03-20</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/get-out-2017/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/F-qUqcN3CF-VsNS0o6Gp3h7LmcxMHpnX_zdVNWZJxRrFZi8jwXya8ogdAYU9za_tEo6Skfb2xkBEefJOZ-hyjzjz5ujxGCK-GdEsctW6i5-2ttY5VeWg-0pgk0hYSu37mxlWFQ=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewing this one without spoilers will prove difficult. Bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Kaluuya stars as Chris, a young photographer. Chris&amp;#39;s girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams), takes him home to meet her parents at their remote estate. Chris is apprehensive because Rose hasn&amp;#39;t told her family he&amp;#39;s black. She assures him everything will be fine. Everything is not fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forgive my not revealing more but, as Roger Ebert often said, it&amp;#39;s not what the film is about, but how it is about it. With &lt;em&gt;Get Out&lt;/em&gt;, writer/director Jordan Peele offers a horror film that&amp;#39;s a meditation on racism in America, but not how you&amp;#39;d expect. Every time I thought I knew where he was going, Peele surprised me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extends to the execution. Horror films sink or swim based on how they handle the tropes. The best filmmakers define, perfect, upend, or avoid them. Peele embraces them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow me to spoil a single scene to make my point. It&amp;#39;s the middle of the night. Chris has endured a rough day with Rose&amp;#39;s family. He&amp;#39;s tired, on edge, and can&amp;#39;t sleep. He sneaks out for a cigarette. Outside he sees—wait, I changed my mind. I can&amp;#39;t spoil the scene; it&amp;#39;s too good. But consider how Peele embraces the trope of drawing the protagonist into a spooky situation. Chris doesn&amp;#39;t investigate an odd noise, or similar clunky idiot plot behavior, his motives feel organic. As for what he sees, well, it&amp;#39;s scary, bizarre and humorous all at once. Peele leverages the setup&amp;#39;s inherent suspense and channels it into an original payoff. It&amp;#39;s genre Aikido.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, aside from Rose&amp;#39;s brother&amp;#39;s part feeling underwritten or severely edited, the film shines. It&amp;#39;s not until the third act, when the film&amp;#39;s cards are on the table, that it falters. We&amp;#39;ve grown so enamored with Peele&amp;#39;s ability to repurpose the genre&amp;#39;s staples, that it feels like a letdown when he indulges in a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this point, I&amp;#39;m torn. I love the third act&amp;#39;s gleefully gory, over the top nature, but it feels like a safety net. Like a comedian following a raw emotional truth with a punchline. The finale plays well, but Peele earned a darker, more honest ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t wait to see what he does next.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph Trail&lt;/em&gt; was the fourth production, following &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-big-stampede-1932/&quot;&gt;The Big Stampede (1932)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, under a six-picture contract Wayne signed with Warner Bros. It recycles footage from Ken Maynard&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Red Raiders (1927)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Warner Bros. acquired First National Pictures a few years prior, they inherited the rights to several popular silent westerns starring Maynard. These were A-list productions showcasing Maynard&amp;#39;s impressive stunt work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warner Bros. figured they could save money by reusing the Maynard action footage in new pictures. They just needed an actor who matched Maynard&amp;#39;s build. Enter Wayne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This picture sees Wayne play calvary scout John Trent. When his comrade and good pal Jonesy is killed to prevent completion of a telegraph line, Trent and his buddy Tippy (Frank McHugh) set out to apprehend the culprits. Along the way, they encounter hostile natives incited by corrupt trader Gus Lynch (Albert J. Smith). There&amp;#39;s also the obligatory love interest for Wayne, played by Alice Keller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wayne&amp;#39;s prior pictures for Warner Bros. saddled him with subpar supporting casts, but this time he gets McHugh, a great character actor, and Smith, a great heavy. But the lackluster result proves Wayne still had lots to learn. It doesn&amp;#39;t help that he and Keller have minimal chemistry, or that the finale drags on far too long and reuses the same recycled footage multiple times. Later in his career, Wayne could have carried the film, but at this point, he struggles to hold his own.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe not exactly, but I admired the gumption. Few films would dare hurtle so far over the top, and if they dared, they&amp;#39;d build up to it. &lt;em&gt;Island of Death&lt;/em&gt; gives us that scene in the first 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to make an unintentional parody? Director Nico Mastorakis offers no indication he sought to satirize the exploitation horror genre, but his film is so ridiculous, modern horror audiences are bound to take it as comedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot concerns a young couple played by Behling and Jane Lyle who arrive on the Greek island of Mykonos and embark on a thrill-kill spree. That&amp;#39;s it. It doesn&amp;#39;t pretend to have a deeper purpose or meaning. It&amp;#39;s all shock for shock&amp;#39;s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, it&amp;#39;s surprisingly well done. Mastorakis makes terrific use of the photogenic locales and enlivens the over-the-top violence with inventive camerawork. Consider the nocturnal chase through the city&amp;#39;s labyrinthine alleys. Mastorakis heightens the sense of panic by using a fish-eye lens and several low-angles shots from the victim&amp;#39;s point-of-view. In a lesser film, such choices would feel gimmicky, but they work here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assured photography contrasts with the uneven performances. Though the supporting players are either wooden or over-the-top, Behling and Lyle play their parts so straight they verge on camp. As parody, the performances are inspired. Behling&amp;#39;s delivery alone is priceless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By his own account, Mastorakis made &lt;em&gt;Island of Death&lt;/em&gt; after seeing &lt;em&gt;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)&lt;/em&gt;. That film&amp;#39;s box-office success lead him to believe an even more extreme picture would make even more money. This naked ambition manifests in an everything-but-the-kitchen sink approach that pushes the film past any genuine scares or mean-spirited umbrage, and firmly into parody. Were I to enumerate the film&amp;#39;s assorted affronts to good taste it would appear brutal, yet I came away entertained. &lt;em&gt;Island of Death&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#39;t for everyone, but exploitation fans will love it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It started with an internet movie review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Collins publishes &lt;a href=&quot;http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Horror Movie a Day&lt;/a&gt;. For the site&amp;#39;s first six years, Collins watched and reviewed a horror movie every single day. Two months into his run, buried in a fifty-film “Chilling Classics” DVD pack, Collins discovered &lt;em&gt;Cathy&amp;#39;s Curse&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com/2007/04/cathys-curse.html&quot;&gt;His review&lt;/a&gt; crowned it the “Best/Worst” film he&amp;#39;d seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Cathy&amp;#39;s Curse&lt;/em&gt; was a cult film, Collins became the cult leader. As his site&amp;#39;s audience grew, Collins kept recommending the film and even posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com/2009/03/cathys-curse-commentary-now-live.html&quot;&gt;a commentary track&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this exposure convinced Severin Films to acquire the rights and sponsor a 2k restoration.  In recognition of Collins&amp;#39; efforts, they invited him to record a new audio commentary for the Blu-ray release. Said release also included a limited theatrical run, which is how I found myself watching &lt;em&gt;Cathy&amp;#39;s Curse&lt;/em&gt; on the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story follows a couple and their young daughter as they move back into the husband&amp;#39;s childhood home. A malevolent spirit possesses the daughter leading to lots of profanity, extreme acne, and several unexplained deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s as bad as &lt;a href=&quot;http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com/2007/04/cathys-curse.html&quot;&gt;Collins&amp;#39; review&lt;/a&gt; claims, with inane dialog, incomprehensible editing, and whiplash performances. Aside from one scene, where a drunken groundskeeper finds himself covered in snakes and spiders, it&amp;#39;s a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, I found myself bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cathy&amp;#39;s Curse&lt;/em&gt; achieved cult status as a so-bad-it&amp;#39;s-good film. One with flaws so obvious and fixable, it was as though the filmmakers were blissful idiots. But watching the restored digital projection, the film looked too good. Cleaning up the picture made the film feel less like an inept amateur effort and more like a lazy professional one. The added scenes smoothed over the worst editing mishaps but added to the film&amp;#39;s glacial pacing. Several scenes elicit laughs, but they&amp;#39;re few and farther between. It&amp;#39;s still bad, but so-bad-it&amp;#39;s-good? Not so much.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Then I realized he makes the film work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picking up where &lt;em&gt;John Wick (2014)&lt;/em&gt; ended, we follow John Wick as he rebuilds his house, sends his car for repairs, and tries to resume a normal life. I liked how these scenes acknowledge the mess action pictures leave in their wake. But soon enough, a smarmy mafioso appears, calling in a marker and forcing Wick back into life as an assassin. We meet a delightful array of supporting characters and thrill as Wick offs dozens of bad guys using knives, guns, cars, pens—you name it—before an obligatory double-cross makes him the target of every assassin in New York City. The film doesn’t so much end as set up another installment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may read like a direct-to-video production, but &lt;em&gt;John Wick: Chapter 2&lt;/em&gt; transcends the action genre, thanks to Reeves. It starts with the cognitive dissonance he creates. How he marches through the film with a shadow limp. The closeups that betray his fifty-two years. The weariness behind his eyes that clashes with his surfer-dude delivery. How nothing in the film surprises him. I have a theory that ties it all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider, if you will, that the John Wick universe, with its surreal characters, superhuman assassins, and over-the-top violence, isn’t attempting to pass as real. And consider further that the John Wick character isn’t reluctant to kill out of a moral quandary, but because he knows he can’t lose. In this respect, Reeves’ weary delivery fits perfectly. How many times has he played this story out? His final line, saying “I’ll kill them all,” isn’t a warning or a threat, but a plea. He’s already killed them all, countless times. He’s a self-aware action hero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, it’s a stretch, and the third installment will likely prove me wrong, but I’m looking forward to it, regardless.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film opens with a man saying goodbye to his wife and young son. The man’s name is Carrère. He is a white-collar criminal and today marks his first day in prison. We meet his cellmates: Lassalle, an older librarian who says little, Marcus, a brash young man whose large breast implants clash with his brawny physique, and Pâquerette, a man-child with a penchant for eating things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After establishing these characters and their interpersonal dynamics, the plot kicks into gear. The men discover an old diary that doubles as a spell book. Eager to escape, the men try some incantations but discover magic carries a high cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I relished this premise. Taking four desperate (but not fierce) men and dangling a supernatural means of escape overflows with potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carrère and Lassalle are well-cast. As Carrère, Gérald Laroche provides a grounded audience surrogate whose gradual transformation into a bitter convict carries the film. As Lassalle, Philippe Laudenbach adds gravitas, communicating volumes with his weary looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was fine with Clovis Cornillac as Marcus, but his character felt underwritten—his transgenderedness regulated to a plot device. As Pâquerette, Dimitri Rataud’s performance felt artificial. I kept hoping the film would reveal Pâquerette as a calculating mastermind masquerading as an imbecile, but no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the story devolves into a predictable version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey&#39;s_Paw&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Monkey’s Paw&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. What begins with echoes of Lovecraft ends like an episode of &lt;em&gt;Tales from the Crypt&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a film that took these characters—one imprisoned in his body, one in his mind, one in his wealth—and explored their prisons and the lengths they would go for freedom. &lt;em&gt;Maléfique&lt;/em&gt; is not that movie. It’s not a bad film, just a disappointing one.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director Dario Argento&amp;#39;s debut feature stars Tony Musante as Sam, an American writer living in Rome. Walking the streets one night, Sam passes an art gallery. Glancing inside, he spies a mysterious black-clad assailant attacking a woman with a knife. Unable to gain entry, Sam stands helpless as the attacker escapes and the woman lies bleeding on the floor pleading for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haunted by his memories, Sam joins the investigation, causing the killer to target him and his live-in girlfriend, played by Suzy Kendall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argento&amp;#39;s visual style grabs you from the get-go. Consider the art gallery scene. The establishing shot sees a bright light shining out of the building&amp;#39;s glass facade, drawing our eyes along with Sam&amp;#39;s. Inside, the woman&amp;#39;s white dress blends with the white walls and floor, forcing our gaze to the black-clad assailant and the woman&amp;#39;s crimson blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a terrific use of contrast; a technique that Argento perfects in my favorite shot, which I shall endeavor to describe. It occurs later in the film, Sam has tracked the killer into a darkened room. As Sam enters, Argento cuts to a wide shot. The only light comes from the doorway. Sam&amp;#39;s silhouette moves to the center of the otherwise pitch-black screen. Then the lights come on and the colors reverse to startling effect. That Argento would even try such a tricky shot shows his confidence. That he pulls it off heralds a major talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Argento&amp;#39;s visual focus can also be a detriment, particularly when he treats his characters as props rather than people. The most grievous example comes when Suzy Kendall&amp;#39;s character finds herself under siege by the killer. She flees into her apartment and locks and barricades the heavy door. She looks for another way out. Finding none, she crumbles to the bathroom floor and sobs hysterically while the killer stabs at the apartment door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, Argento gets some memorable shots of a wide-eyed Kendall clinging to the bathroom sink, but the scene lost me. By having her scour the apartment for an exit, Argento reveals the lack of another &lt;em&gt;entry&lt;/em&gt;. After locking and barricading the door, she need only grab a weapon and wait. Granted, it might be a long wait—boring through inches of hardwood with a kitchen knife takes time—but should the killer poke a limb through, she could stab or bludgeon it. Instead, Argento has her wail around on the floor as though the killer were literally breathing down her neck. What begins tense and stylish, drags and devolves into overwrought indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This illustrates a fundamental misconception on Argento&amp;#39;s part: that showing us a terrified character is enough to make &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; terrified. It&amp;#39;s not, and such moments mar an otherwise inventive thriller.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, it’s good for a laugh. Seeing Humphrey Bogart shed his terry cloth trench coat to reveal a deep-cut two-piece is comedy gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the movie surrounding this scene? I watched it some years back and thought it awful. Revisiting it for this review reaffirmed my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priscilla Lane stars as Linda, a secretary in an advertising agency who dreams of climbing the corporate ladder and drawing a salary instead of wages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as her career takes off, she marries Jimmy, played by Wayne Morris. Jimmy is an ex-footballer from Princeton turned ad-man. When Linda works overtime and misses the big Princeton football game, Jimmy demands Linda quit her job. Linda agrees, and several months later they’ve settled into a bland suburban existence with Linda playing the role of dutiful housewife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still ambitious, Linda arranges a promising business venture for Jimmy, but Jimmy turns it down. Furious, Linda leaves Jimmy and resumes her career. Soon, she’s near the top of the ladder, working long nights alongside fellow advertising executive Harry, played by Bogart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despondent, Jimmy throws himself into his work and achieves a large measure of success. As Harry makes his feelings for Linda clear, Linda realizes she’ll have to choose between Harry and Jimmy. She chooses poorly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romantic comedies require us to like at least one of the leads. In &lt;em&gt;Men Are Such Fools&lt;/em&gt;, I loathed them both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jimmy displays no regard for Linda’s dreams and ambitions, behaving as though he’s entitled to her attention and affection. When Linda cancels a dinner date with Jimmy to sell her boss on an ad campaign, Jimmy crashes the meeting. When a senior executive talks to Linda at a party, Jimmy sulks in a corner rather than join in the conversation. And don’t forget Linda&amp;#39;s near-unforgivable crime of missing the Princeton game with Jimmy and his fraternity buddies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jimmy’s so chauvinistic it’s almost comical. But everyone in the film acts as though his behavior is acceptable. They laugh and chalk it up to young love. That’s when you realize it’s not Jimmy who’s supposed to be funny, but Linda for prioritizing her career over a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to Linda, who I loathed even more than Jimmy. You see, she doesn’t endure his behavior, she encourages it. Consider how Jimmy gets her to marry him. They’re at a pool party thrown by one of Linda’s bosses. Linda’s talking to a high level executive. Furious that Linda would dare talk to another man, Jimmy stalks across the party, grabs Linda, pulls her into the pool and demands she marry him. When Linda says no, he pushes her head under water. He waits a beat, then lets her up. As Linda gasps for air, Jimmy repeats his demand. Again she says no. Back under she goes. This repeats—in full view of the guests, most of whom are Linda&amp;#39;s superiors at work—until Linda agrees. And when she does, it’s not with resentment, but with a doe-eyed smile full of adoration for this man who just bullied her into marrying him. Now, I ask you, who’s worse: the ass or the woman who reinforces the behavior?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going to write something about the ending, and how it lacks a clear message, leaving you wondering just what the film was trying to say, but why bother? There’s only one way to enjoy &lt;em&gt;Men Are Such Fools&lt;/em&gt;: 1. Start the movie. 2. Fast-forward to Bogart’s introduction. 3. Laugh at his outfit. 4. Turn off the movie. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s that kind of movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story concerns a college-aged punk rock band who accept a gig at an out-of-the-way club in the Pacific Northwest. I&amp;#39;ll reveal no more, lest I spoil how writer/director Jeremy Saulnier ratchets up the tension by raising the stakes with each plot twist. Suffice it to say, things get very bad, very fast for the young band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Green Room&lt;/em&gt; is Saulnier&amp;#39;s third film. His debut, &lt;em&gt;Murder Party (2007)&lt;/em&gt;, was a flawed but entertaining black comedy. His follow-up, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/blue-ruin-2013/&quot;&gt;Blue Ruin (2013)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, was a near-perfect revenge thriller. With &lt;em&gt;Green Room&lt;/em&gt;, he delivers one of the more intense horror films I&amp;#39;ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the moment the band turns into the club&amp;#39;s parking lot, we feel uneasy. A palpable sense of menace hangs in the air. It grows as the kids make their way inside the club. By the time they take the stage, it&amp;#39;s overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesser horror films force their characters to behave in service of the plot. We spend such films yelling “Get out of the house!” or something similar at the idiots on screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Green Room&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t do this. Saulnier&amp;#39;s characters behave true to their established personalities. The kids sense something&amp;#39;s off, but they stay anyway. In part because they&amp;#39;re desperate for cash, but more so because they love playing music, and the film conveys the transcendent joy they experience on stage. Later, when things turn bad, the kids continue to react in a plausible and relatable manner. They don&amp;#39;t panic or fall for obvious traps. They play it smart. Except—and here lies the film&amp;#39;s genius—Saulnier paints his villains even smarter. They don&amp;#39;t panic or make stupid mistakes either. It&amp;#39;s all so refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also gruesome. Saulnier punctuates his plot twists with sudden, brutal bursts of violence driven home with convincing practical effects. It&amp;#39;s not a gore-fest, but it&amp;#39;s not for the squeamish either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s because Saulnier makes sure we care about his characters. Good effects suspend disbelief but good storytelling generates empathy. Saulnier&amp;#39;s prior efforts demonstrated a knack for creating flawed but endearing protagonists and quickly fleshing them out without resorting to awkward exposition or trite visuals. In &lt;em&gt;Green Room&lt;/em&gt;, he gives us a whole band full. He even avoids gender stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that I have not mentioned the cast. They&amp;#39;re all convincing and engaging, but discussing specific performances, or even the casting itself would invite spoilers. That said, I&amp;#39;ll make one exception since the film&amp;#39;s promotional artwork includes him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How I envy the festival audiences who went in knowing little more than the film&amp;#39;s title and director. Patrick Stewart&amp;#39;s reveal as a neo-Nazi gang leader must have been a terrific surprise. He&amp;#39;s an unconventional choice, but he pulls off the part. Granted, he&amp;#39;s not as scary as say, Ben Kingsley in &lt;em&gt;Sexy Beast (2000)&lt;/em&gt; or Stacy Keach in &lt;em&gt;American History X (1998)&lt;/em&gt;, but maybe that&amp;#39;s a good thing. &lt;em&gt;Green Room&lt;/em&gt; is intense enough.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the third production, following &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/ride-him-cowboy-1932/&quot;&gt;Ride Him, Cowboy (1932)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, under a six-picture contract John Wayne signed with Warner Bros. It&amp;#39;s a remake of &lt;em&gt;The Land Beyond the Law (1927)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Warner Bros. acquired First National Pictures a few years prior, they inherited the rights to several popular silent westerns starring Ken Maynard. These were A-list productions showcasing Maynard&amp;#39;s impressive stunt work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warner Bros. sought to remake the Maynard silents with sound, recycling as much action footage as possible, reshooting only the close-ups and interiors. They just needed an actor who matched Maynard&amp;#39;s build. Enter Wayne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except, &lt;em&gt;The Big Stampede&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t offer much action. Wayne plays John Steele, a deputy lawman sent to clean up the New Mexico territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He arrives in town and poses as a drunken drifter while sizing up local cattle baron Sam Crew. Then John is on the frontier, befriending a wagon train leader named Cal and making eyes at Cal&amp;#39;s niece Ginger. Then the train comes under attack from Sam Crew&amp;#39;s gang. To apprehend the gang, John recruits Sonora Joe, a Mexican bandit who first tries to rustle the wagon train&amp;#39;s cattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this sounds disjointed, then I have conveyed the sense of watching this film. The script abandons plot threads with no regard for logic or continuity. It also contains an inordinate number of speaking parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which begs the question: If the point of remaking the Maynard films was to save money, why shoot such a complex and talky script? Casting and shooting so much new footage cost time and money. The only memorable bit of recycled footage is the titular stampede, which provides the film&amp;#39;s climax. The wide shots of rampaging cattle and runaway wagons impress. The spliced in close-ups of Wayne shouting things like “Hoo-ah!” do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Wayne, like much of the cast, he appears ill at ease. His scenes with Mae Madison, who plays Ginger, are stiff and awkward. Only Luis Alberni, who plays Sonora Joe, acquits himself well; though hardly well enough to recommend this dull mess.

&lt;p&gt;What is a caper? It&amp;#39;s a film centered on an elaborate ruse perpetrated by lovable rogues. The genre peaked with &lt;em&gt;The Sting (1973)&lt;/em&gt;, then gave way to the grittier heist genre. But while heists get bloody, capers are rarely life-and-death scenarios. Today, the caper picture lies largely forgotten, save the occasional farcical comedy. But director Steven Soderbergh proves the old genre has legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This film&amp;#39;s lovable rogues come together to avenge their mentor (Elliott Gould) who&amp;#39;s been double-crossed by casino mogul Willy Bank (Al Pacino).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get even, the group plans to rob Bank&amp;#39;s casino. The film&amp;#39;s joy lies in how they go about it. The casino&amp;#39;s security system offers only a three-and-a-half minute window. To circumvent this obstacle, the group will rig the games to pay out to everyone. The group needn&amp;#39;t win, just for the casino to lose. So, for three-and-a-half minutes, everybody wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, folks don&amp;#39;t leave when they&amp;#39;re running hot and if they stay, they&amp;#39;ll just lose back their winnings. The thieves&amp;#39; solution to this dilemma provides another of the film&amp;#39;s quirky surprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lesser film might drag under such plotting, but &lt;em&gt;Ocean&amp;#39;s Thirteen&lt;/em&gt; breezes along, thanks to its all-star cast. Opposite Pacino, George Clooney and Brad Pitt star as the lead thieves with Matt Damon as their de facto lieutenant. Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Carl Reiner, and Eddie Izzard round out the crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performers relish the script&amp;#39;s rapid-fire dialogue. Peppered with invented slang and meta references, it&amp;#39;s the film&amp;#39;s biggest treat, and holds up to repeat viewings. The first scene between Clooney and Pacino, with Clooney echoing Pacino&amp;#39;s dialog from &lt;em&gt;The Godfather (1972)&lt;/em&gt; always makes me smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my favorite scene is audacious. It opens with Pitt and Clooney strolling along the Las Vegas Strip, reminiscing. They stop and Clooney gestures off-camera, saying, “I remember when this used to be the Dunes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pitt looks down the street, “The Sands was there, and the Desert Inn…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to a close-up. Both men stand lost in their memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clooney says, “They built them a lot smaller back then.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pitt, still looking where The Sands once stood, says, almost to himself, “They seemed pretty big.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another beat, then Clooney says, “Towns change,” and Soderbergh cuts to a wide shot reveal of the Bellagio dwarfing Clooney and Pitt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this scene. Such self-indulgence should elicit a groan, but between the crackerjack editing and sheer charisma of his stars, Soderbergh gets away with it. It&amp;#39;s a caper-within-a-caper and I fall for it every viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film opens on Christmas Eve. A young boy named Harry wanders downstairs and spies his father, dressed as Santa, fondling his half-naked mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know, I said the film wasn&amp;#39;t sleazy. Stay with me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward thirty years and Harry (now played by Brandon Maggart) has developed an obsession with Santa. His shabby apartment overflows with Christmas knick-knacks and Santa artwork. He spies on the neighborhood children and catalogs their activities in large tomes dedicated to the naughty and nice. He even works in a dingy toy factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Christmas Eve night, Harry dons his handmade Santa costume. At first, he&amp;#39;s overjoyed as he delivers toys to children in a mental hospital. But then his attention turns to the naughty and his mood darkens. A chance confrontation turns violent and bloody. Harry flees, unsure what went wrong. He finds solace in a neighborhood Christmas party where he&amp;#39;s the delight of the local children. But soon he&amp;#39;s alone again, and the high of the party gives way to another dangerous low. More violence follows, spiraling out of control and leading to an outrageous finale that I dare not reveal, but which casts the film as a bittersweet fable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit, I went in expecting a cheesy bit of exploitation but I came out impressed. I liked the film&amp;#39;s production. There&amp;#39;s nary a soundstage in sight. Everything is location-based, including the New Jersey exteriors. The worn, lived-in interiors give the film a documentary veneer and added authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most of all, I liked the film&amp;#39;s willingness  to tell a different kind of story. It hit me during the third act, which sees Harry fleeing a mob of torch-wielding neighbors, that writer/director Lewis Jackson wasn&amp;#39;t making a slasher picture at all, he was making a monster movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the similarities to &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein (1931)&lt;/em&gt;. Both serve as cautionary tales. &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt; warned against playing God. &lt;em&gt;Christmas Evil&lt;/em&gt; warns against playing Santa. It&amp;#39;s a laughable notion until you consider it from a child&amp;#39;s perspective. Moral absolutes like naughty and nice don&amp;#39;t work in the adult world, but try explaining that to a child. The film commits to this premise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, Maggart&amp;#39;s performance makes the film. His character is very much a child trapped in a middle-aged body, and Maggart convinces. The audience I saw the film with offered no snarky chuckles or giggles; they sat transfixed. Much as in &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;, we come to care about this misunderstood monster. The script helps by ensuring Harry never harms a child. It reserves Harry&amp;#39;s murderous outbursts for the film&amp;#39;s real creeps: the other adults. It&amp;#39;s an important detail that lets the film earn its ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I think about &lt;em&gt;Christmas Evil&lt;/em&gt;, the more I admire it. Will it hold up to repeat viewings? I&amp;#39;ll let you know next Christmas.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And those are low standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot concerns—well, I’ve already mentioned the killer snowman, yes? Then, for most readers, I have described the plot in sufficient detail. For those still curious, the film opens with Federal agents transporting a serial killer (named Jack Frost, of course) to his execution. The icy conditions cause the paddy wagon to collide with a top-secret government tanker truck. The truck’s contents spray out, melting the killer&amp;#39;s skin and bones. His liquid remains merge with the snow, granting him a second life as a snowman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a reasonable setup. The problem lies in the execution. Had the film played as a straight horror whose antagonist happens to be a snowman, it might have worked. Just imagine the absurdist humor in swapping Michael Myers for a snowman in &lt;em&gt;Halloween (1978)&lt;/em&gt;. But &lt;em&gt;Jack Frost&lt;/em&gt; drowns in a sea of camera winks and awkward comedy bits. It’s not a horror film, it’s a manufactured attempt at “so-bad-it’s-good” schlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that approach to work, the titular killer snowman needs to be an anti-hero; someone we can perversely root for as he offs the self-centered jerk taking up two parking spaces during the holiday rush, the obnoxious boss who overworks his employees on Christmas Eve, and yes, even the ungrateful kid who’s unhappy with his gifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jack Frost&lt;/em&gt; offers no such vicarious thrills. The serial killer turned snowman is out to fulfill a petty revenge pact against the small-town sheriff who arrested him. It’s an uninspired plot for an uninspired film that’s neither scary nor funny; and thus, not worth your time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horror fans will recognize the plot. A young couple moves to a small, isolated village where they hope to renovate an old house. They ignore repeated warnings to leave and bad things happen, culminating in the young lovers barricading themselves in their home, fighting to keep an unspeakable evil from gaining entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference is in the details. &lt;em&gt;Straw Dogs&lt;/em&gt; takes place in an English village; the quaint sort you see in romantic comedies. But instead of charming, quirky characters, the residents of this hamlet are leering, hard-drinking thugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Into this rural jungle comes mild-mannered American mathematician David (Dustin Hoffman) and his attractive wife Amy (Susan George). They&amp;#39;re fleeing some vague unrest in America and the village is her childhood home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we meet David and Amy, we get our first indication the film will stray from the formula. They aren&amp;#39;t the typical idyllic couple thrust into danger. David&amp;#39;s condescending manner alienates the few locals who would befriend him but he&amp;#39;s too self-absorbed to notice. His intellectual snobbery leads him to treat Amy like a child. Amy&amp;#39;s petulant responses only reinforce the behavior. Their bickering rings true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot kicks in when some local men, including a former boyfriend of Amy&amp;#39;s, named Charlie, worm their way into a job repairing the couple&amp;#39;s garage roof. The men drag out the work. They ogle Amy. One sneaks into the house and steals a pair of Amy&amp;#39;s panties, which he later flaunts at the pub. Things reach a tipping point when David and Amy discover their cat hung in their bedroom closet. When David proves reluctant to confront the men, Amy presses the issue. David snaps at her. She calls him a coward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conflict between David and Amy sets up the film&amp;#39;s most controversial scene: Charlie raping Amy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a hard scene to watch. I&amp;#39;ve seen the film multiple times, and it doesn&amp;#39;t get any easier. At first, Amy screams and fights back. Charlie slaps her and she crumbles to the floor in slow motion. Resigned to her fate, Amy stops fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Peckinpah twists the knife. He quick cuts between the present and Amy&amp;#39;s intimate memories of David. Amy&amp;#39;s anger toward David swirls and churns inside her. Her resignation turns to passion as she turns from victim to betrayer and embraces her former lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as Amy and Charlie lay entwined, Peckinpah goes for the jugular. One of Charlie&amp;#39;s goon friends enters, holding a shotgun. With some reluctance, Charlie steps aside and watches his friend force himself on Amy at gunpoint. Amy&amp;#39;s shrieks surround us as her violation is absolute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Controversial? Absolutely. Gratuitous? No. The scene is horrifying but necessary. It drives an unspoken wedge between David and Amy, setting up the rest of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finale sees Charlie and gang laying siege to David and Amy&amp;#39;s house. It&amp;#39;s a familiar scene in horror films; the men could just as easily be zombies or other monsters, and Peckinpah uses lots of low-angle shots and foggy backlighting. But the real horror isn&amp;#39;t what&amp;#39;s trying to get in, it&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s coming out between David and Amy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of plot-driven coincidences have led to David sheltering a mentally challenged man in the couple&amp;#39;s attic. The mob outside believes this man murdered a local girl earlier that evening. When the attacks start, Amy urges David to acquiesce to the mob&amp;#39;s demands and turn the man over, but David refuses. Bitter that David will stand up for a stranger but not her, Amy refuses to help. This proves the turning point in their relationship. Later, when Amy&amp;#39;s in trouble, she yells for Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to dismiss &lt;em&gt;Straw Dogs&lt;/em&gt; as misogynistic, but that&amp;#39;s short-sighted. This film hates everyone. While Amy is assaulted, David&amp;#39;s out hunting with the very men who attack her. Of course, the trip was just a ruse to lure him away, but David only accepted to buddy-up with alpha-male Charlie. David would label himself a pacifist but behaves as a sycophant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that goes to what makes the film special. It&amp;#39;s violent, sure, but it&amp;#39;s not the violence that stays with you. Rather, it&amp;#39;s the bleak reflection of human nature. Horror movies tend to paint their protagonists as bland, cookie-cutter stereotypes; their misfortune born out of some trespass or bad luck. Not here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horror of &lt;em&gt;Straw Dogs&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#39;t that it could &lt;em&gt;happen&lt;/em&gt; to us, it&amp;#39;s that the characters could &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; us. By committing to its bleak vision the film projects authority. By making its protagonists monsters themselves, the film transcends the exploitation genre. It may not be entertaining in the conventional sense, but every viewing stays with me for days. I may not like what &lt;em&gt;Straw Dogs&lt;/em&gt; is saying, but I can&amp;#39;t deny its impact.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: A+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>The Getaway (1972)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-getaway-1972//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-getaway-1972/</id><updated>2016-12-05</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-getaway-1972/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3H45oFIj7vXiyg8k4jQ31wblut4vMmI4hmwq_h-b17Q6U78pSN1GXsntFrNmU-QCpQNQnGj_9-Pi=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Getaway&lt;/em&gt; is a slick bit of neo-noir exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve McQueen stars as Doc McCoy, an incarcerated bank robber. The opening credit sequence--cut to the staccato rhythm of an industrial loom--hammers home the hellish, regimented existence of prison life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doc finds himself near breaking after his expected parole is denied. When his wife Carol (Ali McGraw) visits him in jail, Doc cuts the visit short, telling her to contact a man named Beynon and tell him “I&amp;#39;m for sale. His price.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beynon (Ben Johnson) is a greasy operator who sits on the parole board. He pulls some strings and Doc is paroled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doc&amp;#39;s reunion with Carol is a touch of genuine sweetness that transcends the film&amp;#39;s exploitative nature. The near-wordless scenes convey the sudden change in their lives. Reunited, the two experience a brief respite before Doc meets with Beynon to repay his debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job is a local bank. Beynon has already picked the crew. Doc would rather use his own guys, but Beynon won&amp;#39;t budge. With no leverage, Doc agrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The robbery, of course, goes wrong. One of Beynon&amp;#39;s guys panics. Things get bloody. In his trademark fashion, director Sam Peckinpah renders each fatality in graphic slow motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty minutes into the film, the real story begins. Doc and Carol head for Mexico with the loot. The law and Beynon&amp;#39;s gang pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love how the film avoids painting Doc as a hero. He kills without hesitation. There&amp;#39;s even a rough scene where smacks Carol. And yet, McQueen&amp;#39;s performance engenders sympathy. You sense Doc&amp;#39;s desire to be a better man but fear he&amp;#39;ll lose the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s part of the film&amp;#39;s overall sense of dread. In pursuit of Doc, one of Beynon&amp;#39;s gang takes a husband and wife hostage. The wife falls for their captor, degrading herself and humiliating her husband. As Doc and Carol flee, you&amp;#39;re sure they won&amp;#39;t make it. Even when they escape, you&amp;#39;re certain the next close-call will be their last. Chalk that up to Peckinpah&amp;#39;s commitment to grounding the film in a plausible reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sets look worn and dusty. The characters glisten with a perpetual sheen of sweat from the oppressive Texas heat. They eat greasy cheeseburgers, hole up in dingy motels, and travel in oversized cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And those cars make for gripping chase scenes. As characters panic, oversteer, fishtail, and crash, you appreciate the challenge of controlling such large vehicles at high speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the film&amp;#39;s highlight belongs to an on-foot chase. After a con-man switches locker keys with Carol and snags the loot, Doc engages in a desperate pursuit through a crowded train station. The dialog-free sequence crackles with tension and echoes vintage Hitchcock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenes like this, along with McQueen&amp;#39;s charisma and Peckinpah&amp;#39;s stylish editing help gloss over the clunky plot. &lt;em&gt;The Getaway&lt;/em&gt; may be little more than pulp, but it&amp;#39;s damn entertaining.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>Doctor Strange (2016)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/doctor-strange-2016//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/doctor-strange-2016/</id><updated>2016-11-28</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/doctor-strange-2016/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Fy7FUeNQVfMdLwIj_JHquTJoXwp0DquRwvPVURemABSX3aw-9se2e0xZrv-idwOmD1gjJ8T39OCv=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt; offers ephemeral entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in the Marvel cinematic universe, the film stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange, a hotshot neurosurgeon. After a car accident cripples his hands, Strange’s desperate search for a miracle cure leads him to Nepal. There he meets The Ancient One, played by Tilda Swinton, who trains him in the mystic arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strange proves himself an exceptional student. Good thing, as he’s soon under attack from Kaecilius, the Ancient One’s former star pupil. Kaecilius now serves Dormammu, an ancient entity from the Dark Dimension. Soon, Strange is all that stands between Earth and a horrible (but not well explained) fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen this story before in countless martial arts films. An acolyte approaches a great master for training, excels against the odds, then clashes with the master’s once favorite student. This film merely substitutes magic for kung-fu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem lies in the homogenized and watered-down execution. Strange’s arc revolves around him overcoming his arrogance. But the film paints him as a brilliant surgeon far ahead of his colleagues. Is that arrogance? Why not paint Strange as a real monster? The film doesn’t seem comfortable making Strange too unlikable. Thus, Cumberbatch’s Strange plays as a less fun version of Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark from the &lt;em&gt;Iron Man&lt;/em&gt; films. The resulting character feels thin and flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extends to the villains. Mads Mikkelsen can play a great bad guy but fails to register as Kaecilius. The script gives him no edge. We’ve seen the disgruntled student archetype in countless films before, and &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt; offers nothing new. Even Dormammu, who should rank among the most horrific villains in the Marvel oeuvre, fails to terrify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The special effects also fail to connect. We see cities twisting and folding upon themselves like Rubik’s Cubes, but the film fails to surround these scenes with a compelling story. Watching New York transform into an M.C. Escher style visage is impressive, but not engaging. The effects should serve the story, not substitute for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds like I hated the film. I did not. Though I would have preferred his native British accent, I enjoyed Cumberbatch’s performance. The real star, however, is Tilda Swinton. She takes a throw-away archetype and delivers the film’s most memorable character. And as someone who grew up reading the comics, I loved seeing the sentient Cloak of Levitation, even if it was little more than comic relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, after the obligatory post-credit sequence, I left the theater impressed with &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt;. But in retrospect, I could remember images in the film, but none of my feelings upon seeing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a reoccurring effect in the film where characters enter the Astral Plane. Their ethereal bodies float in the air and pass through solid objects. If they try hard enough, they can bump walls or knock things over. It’s an apt enough metaphor for the film. It looks good, but it’s hollow inside and struggles to connect. When you try to grab it, you discover there’s nothing there.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those scenes come early. John Wayne plays a fugitive named John (of course) stowed away aboard a freight train. As the train pulls into the station, lawmen are waiting. After some cat and mouse, John hops a horse and flees into the countryside. The lawmen pursue. John dead-ends at a lake, dismounts, and dives into the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see John underwater, breathing through a reed. It&amp;#39;s not a special effect. I&amp;#39;m not sure how they shot these scenes, but that&amp;#39;s Wayne underwater, breathing through a stick in what looks like a lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After eluding the lawmen, who believe him dead, John surfaces and encounters a gunslinger. The gunslinger, recognizing a fellow desperado, introduces himself as Jones and invites John to join an outlaw gang. John accepts and he and Jones become fast-friends and rivals for the local shopgirl, Sally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, John&amp;#39;s not really a bad guy. He passes notes to Sally warning her of the gang&amp;#39;s intentions. And of course, it was Jones who committed the crime pinned on John. And of course, John doesn&amp;#39;t discover this until the second act&amp;#39;s end. But you know what? I didn&amp;#39;t mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sagebrush Trail&lt;/em&gt; may suffer from predictable plotting, stilted dialog, and fight scenes where the participants punch each other&amp;#39;s shoulders, but I still enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the aforementioned underwater scenes, I liked the location photography and wipe transitions. And the script&amp;#39;s making Jones a flawed but likable character was a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most of all, I liked Wayne. This was his second production for Monogram Pictures, after &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/riders-of-destiny-1933/&quot;&gt;Riders of Destiny (1933)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Though Wayne struggles with the romantic comedy scenes, he&amp;#39;s making strides as a performer. More than ever before, we see flashes of his famous Duke persona. And judging by the underwater scenes, he&amp;#39;s doing some of his own stunts to boot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>The Sentinel (1977)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-sentinel-1977//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-sentinel-1977/</id><updated>2016-11-14</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-sentinel-1977/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kxf7iIKKYoFRZdgn7mW5D-IVUDAGpSn0VjUjuQp1L5vB-Mooasc61eOcROuNr7gtSs9VcbwociKh=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Sarandon saves &lt;em&gt;The Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; from its own excess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film stars Cristina Raines as a fashion model who moves into a fantastic apartment in a converted Brooklyn brownstone. A series of strange encounters with her eccentric neighbors leaves her paranoid and on edge. Her boyfriend, a hot-shot defense attorney played by Sarandon, investigates and uncovers a horrific conspiracy involving the Catholic Church and a gateway to Hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setup invites comparisons to &lt;em&gt;Rosemary’s Baby (1968)&lt;/em&gt;. But unlike that film, which was about women&amp;#39;s reproductive rights, &lt;em&gt;The Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#39;t about anything. It&amp;#39;s an exploitation picture offering a smorgasbord of gore, nudity, lesbianism, human deformities, and female masturbation. I don&amp;#39;t mind these things. I object to the film’s middling execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movie fans will enjoy spotting the once and future stars peppering the cast. José Ferrer as an unnamed robed figure. Ava Gardner as a charming real estate agent. Burgess Meredith as a creepy neighbor. Eli Wallach as a cagey detective. Christopher Walken as Wallach’s grinning partner. Jeff Goldblum as a fashion photographer. Beverly D’Angelo as a mute exhibitionist. An unrecognizable John Carradine as an aging priest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the film wastes its talented ensemble. It regulates most of the former stars, like Ferrer, Gardner, and Carradine, to throwaway roles for name recognition. Other performances veer into camp. Beverly D’Angelo’s memorable scene elicits chuckles instead of chills. Eli Wallach&amp;#39;s phoned-in turn plays as caricature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sprawling cast is a byproduct of the convoluted, nonsensical plot. Consider the scene where a character breaks through a wall in the brownstone and uncovers a plaque bearing an inscription from Dante’s &lt;em&gt;Inferno&lt;/em&gt;. It’s the film in a microcosm: effective and atmospheric, but its logic crumbles under the slightest scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What saved the film for me was Sarandon. Despite sporting a mustache that only adds to the film&amp;#39;s second-rate feel, Sarandon is perfect in his role. He avoids the idiot plot and acts according to character. And there&amp;#39;s just something about him playing a charming but ruthless character that I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I saw &lt;em&gt;The Sentinel&lt;/em&gt;, I thought its mix of camp and shock hit more often than it missed—if only just. Watching it again, I’m not so sure. The performances don’t hold up well to repeat viewings, but Sarandon was every bit as good as I remembered.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story sees American psychologist John Holden (Dana Andrews) travel to London. He&amp;#39;s there to expose self-professed black magician Julian Karswell (Niall MacGinnis) as a fraud. Karswell tries to dissuade Holden, but Holden remains resolute. Karswell then announces Holden will die in three days. Holden is skeptical, but after a series of unexplained events, his skepticism crumbles and he begins to fear for his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the best kind of thriller: one populated by intelligent characters who behave according to their personalities, not the whims of the plot. It avoids cheap jump-scares. Instead, director Jacques Tourneur uses atmosphere to build tension. Shadowy hallways and darkened rooms keep us on edge. And, for the real horror, there&amp;#39;s Niall MacGinnis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved MacGinnis&amp;#39; performance. It&amp;#39;s a perfect combination of charm and menace. There&amp;#39;s a great scene where Holden has broken into Karswell&amp;#39;s palatial home. In the darkness, a house cat transforms into a leopard and attacks. Holden struggles for his life, only escaping once Karswell enters and turns on the lights. Karswell treats the intruding Holden as one would treat a party guest who&amp;#39;d gotten lost looking for the bathroom. By underplaying the role, MacGinnis makes the character all the more sinister. Christopher Lee built a career on similar performances. And yet, MacGinnis conveys a vulnerability beneath the bluster that adds unexpected depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opposite MacGinnis, Andrews delivers a curious turn. His cadence and speech patterns mimic John Wayne&amp;#39;s. They&amp;#39;re so similar, I wonder if it was a deliberate impersonation. This brings up an interesting tangent. The Duke played many roles in many movies, but he never made a straight horror picture. Judging by Andrews&amp;#39; performance here, Wayne could have pulled it off with flair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite the solid script, competent direction and inspired performances, &lt;em&gt;Curse of the Demon&lt;/em&gt; falters. The opening sequence sees the titular demon marching out of the woods. A similar sequence occurs at the film&amp;#39;s end. In both, the demon’s mechanical movement and frozen expression scream rubber suit. My wife thought it resembled a homecoming float. Not only do these shots cheapen the film, they undermine any sense of ambiguity regarding Karswell&amp;#39;s powers. Holden is the audience surrogate. His skepticism is our skepticism. But this falls apart when we know Karswell&amp;#39;s powers are real from the outset. Instead of questioning things along with Holden, we grow impatient waiting for him to catch up. A great psychological thriller devolves into a cheap monster movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can thank producer Hal E. Chester. He added the demon shots after principal photography wrapped. Tourneur and Andrews fought him on it. Writer Charles Bennett threatened to shoot Chester dead. They all lost. The studio, Columbia, did cut some footage for the American release, but not of the monster. What a shame.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>Torso (1973)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/torso-1973//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/torso-1973/</id><updated>2016-10-31</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/torso-1973/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Y_IbflpaJ_iIgxd1thi7OTYEH7xp1iHj-4VSR24Zf_hdegkTj4DiKnlsPbZDUSWau43K9mlO7qXu=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Torso&lt;/em&gt; executes a generic plot with panache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film takes place in scenic Perugia, Italy. A masked killer strangles two female university students, sparking a manhunt. Another student thinks she recognizes the murder weapon, leading to threatening phone calls from the killer. Alarmed, she retreats to a cliff-side villa with four girlfriends, including an American exchange student, played by Suzy Kendall. The killer, of course, follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It plays as a mystery, inviting us to guess the killer’s identity. The script proffers a myriad of suspects, painting almost every male character as possessive, misogynistic, or perverted. The few that appear normal feel suspect by comparison. I admit, it fooled me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mystery aside, what I enjoyed most about &lt;em&gt;Torso&lt;/em&gt; was its style. There’s a scene where the killer tracks a girl through a swampy marsh. The lighting, camerawork, and editing create a kind of kinetic claustrophobia. The more she runs, the more her world shrinks. Even as the tension held me rapt, the sheer craft made me smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it gets better. The last act sees Kendall locked in a bedroom. She slides a piece of newspaper under the door, hoping to catch the key as she forces it out of the lock. I won&amp;#39;t spoil what happens, but I will say this scene caps twenty-some dialog-free minutes that serve as a master class in suspense. They&amp;#39;re so good, I forgave the finale, which sees the killer reveal his identity and explain his psychosis via some awkward and disappointing exposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only problem with &lt;em&gt;Torso&lt;/em&gt; lies with its heroines. I liked how the film paints them as strong, independent women. Fleeing to a remote outpost wasn&amp;#39;t the smartest move, but it was refreshing to see them do something besides run to the nearest man for protection. If only the script had provided them with distinct personalities. Aside from Kendall’s character, they felt interchangeable and never endeared themselves. It’s a common problem with mysteries. We learn more about the various red herrings than about the protagonists.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>The Pit (1981)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-pit-1981//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-pit-1981/</id><updated>2016-10-24</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-pit-1981/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RWu-i9XAIElgsPF4HpQlnhdTYfxFpZP8rncZVWqoLYegY2CFhA4z3m181oKEfq5twCg1-2PXioSr=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pit&lt;/em&gt; careens between laughable and disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We meet Jamie, a twelve-year-old boy transitioning to adolescence. He’s noticed girls and nudie-books, but still clings to his teddy bear. When his parents take a trip, Jamie develops a crush on the live-in babysitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a reasonable set-up for a coming-of-age comedy, but the script takes a different direction. Jamie’s teddy bear urges him to do things. Bad things, like watch his babysitter while she sleeps, or terrorize a neighbor into stripping nude as he snaps Polaroids, or frame a man for murder, or feed people to a pit of trolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way the movie lumps the titular pit in with Jamie’s other deviations is part of its quirky charm. The troll effects look cheap, and the entire premise of luring people into a giant hole in the woods is silly. It’s as though the filmmakers knew they couldn’t make these bits scary, so they opted for weird. It works. Instead of a forgettable monster movie we get oddball schlock. And I love how obnoxious the film paints Jamie’s victims. Early on, Jamie, looking lonesome, approaches an older boy and girl. Jamie says little more than “Hi,” before the older boy punches him in the face. No reason, the boy’s just mean. When Jamie feeds him to the trolls, we’re not sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s another movie lurking beneath the inanity. A much darker one. Bits and pieces surface, like Jamie alluding to his mother molesting him, or the aforementioned scene where he watches his babysitter sleep. These scenes transcend the schlock and convey a genuine sense of unease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, &lt;em&gt;The Pit&lt;/em&gt; is unlike anything I’ve seen. It’s not a good film, but its off-beat nature intrigues. You laugh as Jamie wheels an old biddy into the pit, then feel your skin crawl as he hits on his babysitter. It’s a wild ride.

It traumatized  me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s told from a kid’s point-of view. A boy who’s put away his toys but hasn&amp;#39;t yet discovered girls. His parents died a few months earlier in a car crash. Now, he follows his older brother everywhere. In the process, he uncovers some strange goings-on involving the local mortician, played by Angus Scrimm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love how writer-director Don Coscarelli avoids traditional plot tropes. When no one believes him, the kid breaks into the mortuary. After evading a lethal flying ball, he escapes with a gruesome piece of evidence. The next morning, he shows his older brother, who takes a single look and says, “Okay, I believe you.” A lesser film would see the boy lose the evidence during his escape, or have the older brother dismiss it with some awkward rationalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t reveal any more of the plot, as much of the film&amp;#39;s joy comes from the unexpected directions it takes. It plays like a surreal nightmare. Scenes feel disjointed. We often sense we’re missing something. These seeming plot holes only add to the film’s unrelenting sense of unease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it’s often lumped in with the slasher pictures that dominated early 80s horror, &lt;em&gt;Phantasm&lt;/em&gt; stands apart. It’s equal parts science fiction and dark fantasy. Take out the brief nudity and iconic chrome ball, and you&amp;#39;d have a PG-13 film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But about that ball. Those with squeamish stomachs may find it rough. As a special effect, it’s a collision of imagination,  exploitation, and blood. Lots of blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ball pushed my younger self over the edge. I had nightmares for weeks. So much of the film, from the stark white mortuary interiors to Scrimm himself, looks unsettling. It sounds unsettling too, with an ominous, disconcerting score that adds to the film&amp;#39;s impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching it now, &lt;em&gt;Phantasm&lt;/em&gt; plays like a remake of the film I saw as a child. Scenes tug at memories of a more brutal experience. One that carved itself into my malleable psyche and sewed the seeds of my predilection for nihilistic, nightmarish horror. &lt;em&gt;Phantasm&lt;/em&gt; may not be perfect, but it made an impression.

(1996)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/mars-attacks-1996//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/mars-attacks-1996/</id><updated>2016-10-10</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/mars-attacks-1996/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UaIryK7fdz3ppPVenyCpIZH8N_igIhz5H5gSo31rmY4OQilJabolh4ji7z45AKK3ztNCGlMDiHOQ=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mars Attacks!&lt;/em&gt; could have been awful but settles for mediocre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film jumps between several storylines as aliens from Mars attack Earth. We follow the President and his staff, a pair of television personalities, a family in rural Kansas, a sleazy Las Vegas developer, and a washed up heavyweight boxer. Jack Nicholson leads an all-star cast as both the President and the Vegas developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The studio advertised the film as spoofing 1950s science-fiction pictures, but it doesn’t play that way. Among the cast, it&amp;#39;s telling that amateur actor and former NFL fullback Jim Brown seems the most comfortable. He plays the boxer reduced to dressing as a pharaoh for an Egyptian-themed casino. When the Martians attack, Brown heads out to reunite with his ex-wife (Pam Grier) and kids. He gets some help from Tom Jones, who plays himself. There’s a wonderful scene where Brown asks Jones, “Do you know how to fly a plane?” to which Jones replies, “Of course! You got one?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of goofball casting matches the goofy sci-fi premise.  Brown and Jones both seem aware of their shortcomings as actors, and their stiff performances are genuine and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a glimpse of the movie I suspect director Tim Burton wanted to make. He seems less interested in spoofing the genre than recreating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not a bad idea, but no one told the big-name cast. Few appear to enjoy the material. Most convey a sense of condescension, their performances screaming “I’m overacting on purpose!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did they have a choice? Unlike Brown and Jones, the rest of the cast can’t pretend they’re amateurs. And playing it straight wouldn’t have helped. Pam Grier plays her role with such conviction, her scenes feel spliced in from a different film. Martin Short plays his role as though he were in an overt comedy, to similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least they got the Martians right. The 1950s films featured serious monsters cobbled together with silly effects. Here, we get cartoonish villains brought to life with no visible wires, seams, or zippers. In my favorite scene, the Martians laser a national monument, catch the falling debris with their flying saucer, and redirect the rubble onto a fleeing tour group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, &lt;em&gt;Mars Attacks!&lt;/em&gt; underwhelms. It’s a rare movie that would be much better were it much worse.

&lt;p&gt;It opens with John Wayne on horseback, strumming a guitar and singing a solemn ballad. The voice isn&amp;#39;t Wayne&amp;#39;s, and it&amp;#39;s clear he won&amp;#39;t win any lip-sync awards. After his introduction, Wayne evades some bad guys in a scene that tries for slapstick but fails. Soon, he’s embroiled in a water-rights dispute between some ranchers and a shady businessman. Suffering from laughable dialog and stilted pacing, the film works best when it cuts to the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overseen by Yakima Canutt, the stunts pack a raw, visceral energy. One, a horse and rider diving off a cliff into a lake, proved so impressive, the studio recycled it for later productions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was John Wayne&amp;#39;s first film for Monogram Pictures. Over the next two years, Monogram would cast Wayne as the lead in 16 productions, all westerns. They were quick and cheap shoots, wrapping in a week with budgets of around ten-thousand dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these films, Wayne began crafting his on-screen image. During production, he bonded with the stuntmen over drinks and card games. Many were real cowboys. Wayne’s desire to emulate their physicality and mannerisms formed the foundation of his iconic posture, gait, and cadence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend &lt;em&gt;Riders of Destiny&lt;/em&gt;, but for John Wayne fans it&amp;#39;s an opportunity to watch the fledgling actor workshop a persona that would become legend.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>The Witch (2015)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-witch-2015//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-witch-2015/</id><updated>2016-09-26</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-witch-2015/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ucvDLbqgo5JvXCTKiEugYUB1ayTWCbri8PrvJj7L0cD9COZ8cgaw1okLe7N8a8vb93R21wm8LbjT=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witch&lt;/em&gt; gets better with each viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without revealing too much, the story follows a Puritan family exiled from their plantation in 17th century New England. Alone in the wild, they establish a small farm outside a looming forest. Tragedies beset them. As the stress mounts, they turn against one another, unaware of the horror lurking in the woods nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film requires active listening. Writer-director Robert Eggers sourced his dialog from documents and diaries written during the film’s period. The resulting English sounds a step removed from our own, packed with thees and thous and unfamiliar inflections. Those expecting to sit back, tune out, and be entertained may find themselves frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Eggers rewards our attention. The film’s credibility astounds. The production built a working farm and lit it with near-natural light sources. Eggers scoured Canada for a forest that could pass for New England woodland. The remote location he chose doubles well enough, yet still seems alien and ominous. It’s an immersive experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cast helps. Everyone impresses, but Anya Taylor-Joy astounds. Her performance as a teenage girl coming of age on a puritanical farm feels both original and authentic, and  she delivers it with startling ease. The only thing I didn&amp;#39;t buy were her teeth. Like the rest of the cast, they were too perfect. In a lesser picture, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a film of jump-scares or gory set pieces. The story unfolds with a grim, nihilistic inevitability. Take out the supernatural elements and you still have a riveting drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s what makes &lt;em&gt;The Witch&lt;/em&gt; so special. It works as a horror movie. It works as a drama. It works as a fable. It works as an indictment of patriarchal societies. Like all great films, it rewards subsequent viewings. Whether you&amp;#39;re savoring the attention to detail, or exploring the subtext, the film satisfies. As of this writing, I’ve seen it twice. That&amp;#39;s not nearly enough.

This may not be the film&amp;#39;s most ridiculous scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the second production, following &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/haunted-gold-1932/&quot;&gt;Haunted Gold (1932)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, under a six-picture contract John Wayne signed with Warner Bros. It’s a remake of &lt;em&gt;The Unknown Cavalier (1926)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Warner Bros. acquired First National Pictures a few years prior, they inherited the rights to several silent westerns starring Ken Maynard. These were popular, A-list productions featuring Maynard’s impressive stunt work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warner Bros. sought to remake the Maynard silents with sound, recycling as much footage as possible, reshooting only the close-ups and interiors. All they needed was an actor who matched Maynard’s build. Enter Wayne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wayne plays a wandering cowboy who tries to apprehend a mysterious outlaw known as The Hawk, only to end up framed for the outlaw&amp;#39;s crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening sequence reveals The Hawk&amp;#39;s identity, so there&amp;#39;s no mystery. It also telegraphs the finale by introducing someone who can identify The Hawk. Granted, said person lies comatose but, as the doctor says, “He&amp;#39;ll be fine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This absurdity continues to the aforementioned horse trial, through Wayne&amp;#39;s introduction, and to his framing. This consists of The Hawk dropping Wayne&amp;#39;s monogrammed harmonica after raiding a homestead. That&amp;#39;s all the town needs to lynch Wayne. As they say, “We&amp;#39;ve got incontrovertible proof.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, despite the inanity, or perhaps because of it, the script surprises. When the female lead finds herself surrounded by The Hawk&amp;#39;s gang, she isn’t captured. Instead, she displays surprising wit and actually rescues Wayne. It&amp;#39;s only &lt;em&gt;later&lt;/em&gt; that she’s captured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Wayne, he&amp;#39;s still learning. You catch glimpses of his iconic persona, such as his reaction shots during his sham trial, but they&amp;#39;re rare.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story sees a trio of teens burgle a blind man&amp;#39;s dilapidated Detroit home. But the mark proves resourceful, and soon the kids are fighting to escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the kids into the house takes forever. We sit through pages of clunky exposition meant to endear the kids to us. It does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once inside, we’re treated to the film’s lone highlight. The kids&amp;#39; initial encounter with the blind man crackles with palpable tension. I gasped aloud when one character revealed his presence via a creaky floorboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the plot kicks in, shuffling the characters from one set piece to another with no relatable behavior or convincing motivation. It&amp;#39;s lazy writing run amok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time passed, I grew restless. The script ignores the obvious. The man is blind. Grab a hammer, hide behind a door, and brain him. None of the teens try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sense of humor might have saved the movie. But it piles one outlandish plot twist upon another without even a wink toward its own inanity. Even worse, the twists turn downright ugly, proving &lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#39;t Breathe&lt;/em&gt; would rather push our buttons than tell a compelling story.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first movie produced under a six-picture contract Wayne signed with Warner Bros. It&amp;#39;s a remake of &lt;em&gt;The Phantom City (1928)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Warner Bros. acquired First National Pictures a few years prior, they inherited the rights to several silent westerns starring Ken Maynard. These were popular, A-list productions featuring Maynard’s impressive stunt work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warner Bros. sought to remake the Maynard silents with sound, recycling as much footage as possible, reshooting only the close-ups and interiors. All they needed was an actor who matched Maynard’s build. Enter Wayne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wayne plays a cowboy investigating an abandoned mine. It’s a dull, talky story involving half-shares in mines, frame-ups, betrayals, and a mysterious Phantom. One assumes Maynard&amp;#39;s version had more life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wayne&amp;#39;s performance is stiff and unsure, lacking even a glimpse of his signature laconic persona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there’s Blue Washington as Wayne’s sidekick. It’s an unfunny and demeaning role that sees him referred to as “boy” by Wayne and “watermelon mouth” by the villains. It makes a bad movie even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warner Bros. may have known they had a turkey on their hands. They shot and released two more Maynard remakes with Wayne, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/ride-him-cowboy-1932/&quot;&gt;Ride Him, Cowboy (1932)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-big-stampede-1932/&quot;&gt;The Big Stampede (1932)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, before releasing this stinker.

&lt;p&gt;The plot concerns a group of incarcerated super-villains made to form a super-powered Delta Force. Will Smith plays Deadshot, an assassin who never misses. Margot Robbie plays Harley Quinn, a former psychiatrist whose super-power is finding The Joker attractive. Viola Davis plays Amanda Waller, the puppet-master who sells the project to the Washington brass. The rest of the cast fall somewhere between underwritten and extraneous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dirty Dozen (1976)&lt;/em&gt;, this ain&amp;#39;t. Deadshot won&amp;#39;t kill women or children. Harley&amp;#39;s just a brat in love with a psycho. &lt;em&gt;The Bad News Bears (1976)&lt;/em&gt; had more edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the Batman cameo disappoints. In &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-2016/&quot;&gt;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Batman erupted from the shadows to cripple thugs with brutal efficiency. Here, he floats down well-lit side streets to tap super-villains on the shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only characters packing genuine menace are Waller and The Joker, neither of whom is on the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Joker is hardly in the film. Jared Leto mashes up Heath Ledger&amp;#39;s intensity in &lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight (2008)&lt;/em&gt; with Jack Nicholson&amp;#39;s flamboyant camp in &lt;em&gt;Batman (1989)&lt;/em&gt;. The resulting performance is awful, but at least it holds your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest is forgettable. There&amp;#39;s a scene eighty-some-minutes in where the squad rescues Waller. I thought the movie over. But I&amp;#39;d forgotten the film&amp;#39;s antagonists, a pair of supernatural entities bent on world destruction or some-such. Instead of the end-credits, I faced forty more minutes of contrived plot and overwrought CGI, most of which I&amp;#39;d forgotten before I left the theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anita Ekberg plays Sister Gertrude, a hospital matron with an unhinged psyche. She complains of intense headaches and steals to support a morphine addiction. Outside the hospital, she drinks, smokes, and has anonymous sex. During dinner, she reprimands a patient by stomping their dentures to pieces. In bed with a young nun, she orders her would-be paramour to “Say you&amp;#39;re a dirty whore.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, when patients turn up murdered, Sister Gertrude is the prime suspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this point, the film has abandoned the lurid sleaze and manic energy that carried the first half. In their place, we get a convoluted scheme to replace the head physician and a flimsy mystery. Worse still, we guess the big twist, making the film&amp;#39;s final half tedious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Killer Nun&lt;/em&gt; is trash, but not total trash, and that&amp;#39;s a shame.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone younger with a fuller build might have pulled it off. William Holden or Kirk Douglas, maybe. But at 49, Humphrey Bogart looks ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story opens during World War II with Bogart as an enlisted pilot leading bombing runs and romancing a Red Cross worker played by Eleanor Parker. When he&amp;#39;s ordered home, Bogart and Parker try to marry but a series of contrivances thwarts their efforts and Bogart leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to present day where more contrivances see a washed-up Bogart land a test pilot job for an aviation mogul played by Raymond Massey. Of course, Parker shows up as Massey’s secretary. She’s dating Massey’s chief engineer, played by Richard Whorf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflict arises when Bogart suggests piloting Massey’s experimental fighter jet from Alaska to Washington, D.C. It’s a stunt to convince the Washington brass the plane is ready for production. Whorf opposes the stunt, convinced the jet needs the new safety features he&amp;#39;s developing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massey wants to produce the fighter now. Bogart wants the money the stunt will net him so he can propose to Parker. Whorf wants time to finish his safety innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Bogart races to Washington clad in the aforementioned flight suit, Whorf races to implement his new designs, using himself as a test pilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a passable story buried in &lt;em&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/em&gt;, but Bogart’s wrong for the role. The laughable sight of him squeezed into the flight suit distracts from the script’s foresight. Though common enough today, escape pods, pressurized flight suits, and braking parachutes were science fiction to 1950s audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding matters, the film pushes the melodrama, despite the three leads having no chemistry. Will Bogart and Parker get back together? Will there be obstacles to their romance? I think you know the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting film feels like one of Bogart’s pre-&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/casablanca-1942/&quot;&gt;Casablanca (1942)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; pictures that saw him cast in whatever assembly line production Warners was cranking out that week. Bogart deserved better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And really, what were they thinking with that flight suit?&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The film follows Bulger’s ascent from small-time hood to crime-lord of South Boston. A journey made possible by the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the film, the Feds offer Bulger a sweet deal. In exchange for information on the Italian mob in North Boston, the FBI leave Bulger’s crew alone. Even better, they eliminate the competition. Best of all, Bulger’s FBI handler is a South Boston native who idolizes him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the FBI ask is that Bulger not kill anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, Bulger kills people. He executes one of his lackeys. His gang somehow gets involved in Jai Alai and Bulger orders the commissioner killed. He strangles a young girl who may have talked to the cops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last murder was where the film lost me. It’s late in the film and the script introduces the girl only for Bulger to kill her five minutes later. The scene plays like something out of a horror movie and does nothing to build characterization or advance the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also meet Bulger’s younger brother, a state senator played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Cumberbatch is good casting. His Boston accent may be jarring, but he’s believable as Depp’s brother. While both men seem too slight for their parts, they’re convincing as family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film invites comparisons with Scorsese’s &lt;em&gt;Goodfellas (1990)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Departed (2006)&lt;/em&gt;, but these comparisons underscore &lt;em&gt;Black Mass&lt;/em&gt;’s weakness: Bulger isn’t a compelling character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see Bulger build his empire, yet have no idea how he spends a typical day. He makes piles of money but, aside from a pair of cowboy boots, we never see him spend it. He suffers what we’re told are life-changing tragedies, yet seems unfazed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depp tries as Bulger, but he can’t compensate for the shallow characterization. He can’t disappear into the character because there is no character, just makeup and an accent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With no psychological insight, &lt;em&gt;Black Mass&lt;/em&gt; feels hollow. We may learn much of Whitey Bulger’s life, but we learn very little about &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I picture you, dear reader, trudging through endless paragraphs of plot synopsis and I feel guilty. I have let you down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My duty as a reviewer is to describe the film. My job as a writer is to respect your time and attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so my challenge is to describe the picture in a succinct manner that holds your interest. Not that different, I suppose, from what I expect of the films I review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But just as I’m willing to humor a movie that stumbles, provided its intentions are good, I ask you, dear reader, to bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The House that Dripped Blood&lt;/em&gt; comprises four stories revolving around an old English country house. They vary in quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first story, &lt;em&gt;Method for Murder&lt;/em&gt;, sees a writer, Charles Hillyer, move into the house along with his wife. Hillyer writes lurid thrillers. He’s certain the house’s creaky atmosphere will help him finish his latest novel. Things take a turn for the macabre when Hillyer sees his literary creation, the murderous strangler Dominic, lurking around the estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a worn premise, but screenwriter Robert Bloch puts a twist on the twist that makes for a satisfying ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second story, &lt;em&gt;Waxworks&lt;/em&gt;, follows a retired businessman named Philip Grayson, played by Peter Cushing. While touring a horrific wax museum in town, Grayson notices a figure that bears a striking resemblance to a girl he loved as a young man. Soon, he’s obsessed with the perceived effigy and, as you suspect, it doesn’t end well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the first installment, you’ll see the twist coming, but Cushing makes it work. Soon to be a widower in real life, Cushing brings a pathos to what’s otherwise a throw-away role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third story, &lt;em&gt;Sweets to the Sweet&lt;/em&gt; is the best. Christopher Lee plays John Reid, a widower. The details surrounding his wife’s death are hazy, and Reid doesn’t seem to miss her. He moves into the house with his young daughter, Jane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival the estate agent gives them a tour of the house. When they reach a room with a lit fireplace, Jane runs crying from the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reid hires a tutor for Jane, insisting she not go to school with other children. Astonished Jane has no toys of her own, the tutor buys her a small doll. Outraged, Reid throws the doll into the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mystery builds to a satisfying conclusion, with Lee exploiting audience expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final story, &lt;em&gt;The Cloak&lt;/em&gt;, concerns an aging, egotistical horror actor named Paul Henderson. In a flat bit of meta-humor, he dismisses the current generation of horror films, saying he prefers the classics, like Dracula. Although he’s quick to add “The Lugosi one, not this new chap.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot kicks in when Henderson acquires a cape that belonged to an actual vampire. Wearing it, Henderson sprouts fangs, loses his reflection, and gains the ability to fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s played as camp, which is a shame. Co-star Ingrid Pitt, strikes the right balance, but Jon Pertwee’s performance as Henderson never hooked me. The resulting segment fails to thrill or amuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthology films are hard to grade. My rating averages the individual segments. The third piece’s excellences cancels the fourth’s failed camp. But Christopher Lee’s segment is enough to recommend &lt;em&gt;The House that Dripped Blood&lt;/em&gt;. After all, if the other stories don’t seem appealing, there’s always the fast-forward button.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gory details aside, the story feels familiar. Attractive young Catherine marries handsome young English nobleman Charles. They move into his ancestral manor. Strange things happen. Bumps in the night. Catherine sees visions of a man with a severed hand and empty, bleeding eye sockets. An unseen apparition rapes her in their marriage bed…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don’t forget the severed hand. It’s always lurking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catherine begins to suspect Charles is keeping something from her. She digs for the truth, but every time she gets close, someone ends up dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, Catherine is pregnant. Charles, worried for her sanity, calls in Dr. Pope, played by Peter Cushing. Pope is like a non-believing Van Helsing in an atrocious wig. Though he’s window dressing tangential to plot, Peter Cushing’s always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the script mishandles the mystery. Rather than dole out clues, it reveals everything in a single flashback before the film’s finale. This approach only works if the script leads the audience to a wrong conclusion before shocking them straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we guess the big twist long before the script gets around to revealing it. Then we have to sit through the drawn out ending. The big reveal should be the climax, not precede it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s the film’s biggest problem. It overstays its welcome. Even at 91 minutes, it’s too long. Granted, the rain during the finale is a nice touch, but, then again, everything in the film looks great. It’s the execution that’s lacking. &lt;em&gt;And Now the Screaming Starts&lt;/em&gt; has all the ingredients for solid gothic thriller. It just screws up the recipe.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As with &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-house-that-dripped-blood-1971/&quot;&gt;The House That Dripped Blood (1971)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the script comes courtesy of Robert Bloch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framing story follows a young doctor named Martin. Martin is interviewing for a position at an asylum for the “incurable insane”. He’s greeted with several surprises. The asylum head, Dr. Starr, has gone insane himself and is now counted amongst the asylum’s patients. Starr’s replacement, Dr. Rutherford, is wheel-chair bound after a patient attack. As if those weren’t enough red flags,  Rutherford makes Martin an unusual offer. Martin can have the job provided he deduces which of the patients is Dr. Starr. Martin protests, but heads upstairs to interview the patients. The bulk of the film illustrates their stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first story concerns a man who murders his wife, chops up her body, wraps the parts in packing paper, and stores them in a basement freezer. Unfortunately, said wife had a magic bracelet. When the husband tosses the bracelet into the freezer, the body parts spring to life, attacking him and his mistress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of stories always fail to suspend my disbelief. Not the resurrection part which is creepy with a nice touch where we see a severed head sucking air through the paper wrap. No, the problem lies in the physics of those body parts moving about. Just because they’re reanimated, it doesn’t give them the ability to fly. Yet, how else to explain a severed head climbing a flight of stairs? We see arms and legs lurching about and it looks laughable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we meet Bruno, a former tailor. Broke and facing eviction, Bruno finds salvation in a mysterious gentlemen named Smith. Played by Peter Cushing, Smith offers an extraordinary sum for Bruno to make a suit for Smith’s son. Smith insists Bruno must work according to Smith’s precise specifications. These include oddities such as only working on the suit during the late night and early morning hours. Bruno agrees to Smith’s demands and, a few nights later, arrives on Smith’s doorstep with the suit. To Bruno’s horror, Smith reveals that he has no money to pay. This will prove to be Smith’s smallest surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what will become a running theme, the special effects are the story’s undoing. Cushing is great, and the story’s mystery held my attention. But the finale relies on another effect I couldn’t swallow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third entry is more grounded. The story concerns a young woman named Barbara, played by Charlotte Rampling. Barbara is fresh from psychiatric care and under the careful watch of her brother and a nurse. Soon, Barbara’s mischievous friend Lucy shows up. Lucy urges Barbara not to take her medication. Not good for Barbara’s brother and nurse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story is most effective of the lot, but the big reveal will be obvious to anyone with a passing knowledge of the horror genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last tale involves Dr. Byron, played by Herbert Lom. Byron has perfected soul transference and transfers his essence into a small effigy. The figure resembles a robot as tall as a can of soda with a plastic Herbert Lom head. It looks as ridiculous as it sounds. The stop motion animation reminded me of the Rankin Bass Christmas specials. Despite its appearance, it’s quite deadly, as Dr. Rutherford soon discovers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What to make of this final tale? I can’t imagine anyone finding it frightening. Did director Roy Ward Baker give up and try for camp?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what of &lt;em&gt;Asylum&lt;/em&gt; as a whole? Given the talent involved, it’s a let down. Instead of exploiting its able cast, &lt;em&gt;Asylum&lt;/em&gt;’s script relies on special effects the production can’t deliver. The one time it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; lean on its cast, it forces poor Charlotte Rampling through a tired trope. Still, it held my attention, so that’s something.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Given the film’s obscurity, my expectations were low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story follows Bud, played by Eric Linden. Bud is a young man from Hoopersville, an Indiana town with a population of just eight thousand. Bud’s inherited a small sum and can’t wait to escape small-town life. He buys a train ticket for New York City. Convinced the big city will eat him alive, the station staff wager Bud will return within a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving, Bud checks into a posh suite at the expensive Hotel Hercules. This at the suggestion of Bud’s only contact in New York, his cousin Gibboney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cousin Gibboney is a fast-talking piece of work. When Bud says he’s paying eight dollars per day for his suite, Gibboney feigns nonchalance. “Well don’t worry about that,” Gibboney says, “I’ll just have that chopped right in half. I’ll speak to the manager of the hotel, he’s an old pal of mine.” Later, Gibboney explains, “That room was supposed to go for twelve dollars a day, but don’t worry, I spoke to the manager and I fixed it. It’s all right. You can have it for eight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gibboney introduces Bud to a couple of chorus girls, including Vida, played by Joan Blondell. Vida and Bud make googly eyes. Gibboney invites the girls to a party in Bud’s suite later that evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Bud’s money, Gibboney acquires some black market booze. Assorted partiers arrive. Bud and Vida flirt, ignoring the crowd and the hooch. Credit the film for accuracy here, as the crowd goes from jubilant antics to a drunken stupor as the night wears on. As the guest begin to leave, there’s a drunken fight between two men, one played by Bogart. The lights go out. When they come back on, one guest is dead. The remaining partygoers flee, including Vida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police figure Bud for the murder, and issue a warrant for his arrest. Alone and short on funds, Bud reunites with Vida in a speakeasy. He uses the last of his money to gamble, hoping to win enough to secure a future with Vida. Bud wins back his losses and then some, but of course, he doesn’t quit while he’s ahead. Bud loses everything. Then the police pounce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film plays as a cautionary fable, but the pre-code script imbues New York with a certain allure. Part of said allure is Blondell as Vida. She’s all wholesome charm tinged with a bad-girl streak. Like a spiked milkshake. Before gambling away his money, Bud wonders if they should just leave. Vida replies, “I don’t wanna leave. I wanna stay where there’s noise and excitement and crowds!” Judging by Bud’s reaction, this is just the response he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linden plays Bud as naive without being cloying. The script helps. In a lesser film, Bud would be judgmental. Here, he doesn’t object to the bootleg gin and he knows his way around a dice game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a great film, but it’s not a bad one either. It held my interest and even offered a chuckle or two via Gibboney’s rapid-fire dialog. I may have watched &lt;em&gt;Big City Blues&lt;/em&gt; for Bogart, but I enjoyed more than just his small role.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Whip and The Body&lt;/em&gt; opens with Lee on horseback approaching a large ocean front castle. He plays Kurt, a young nobleman returning to his ancestral castle after some time away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learn Kurt has something of a notorious reputation and the castle is full of people wishing to do him harm. Soon Kurt is dead under mysterious circumstances, and his ghost is stalking the castle, claiming those who might have killed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also Nevenka, once Kurt’s fiancée, now married to his younger brother. She claims to hate Kurt, but her reactions to his whip say otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every frame in &lt;em&gt;The Whip and The Body&lt;/em&gt; drips gothic atmosphere. The castle interiors are all blue-green hues mixed with inky shadows across stone walls and floors. Think of the old Universal Monster sets brought to glorious technicolor life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where those pictures may have hinted or implied sexual overtones, &lt;em&gt;The Whip and the Body&lt;/em&gt; is overt. Kurt flogs Nevenka and she likes it. By injecting a liberal dose of sex and violence, the film rejuvenates the haunted castle story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film’s only misstep lies in it’s overbearing, generic score. It sounds like something out of a soap opera, not the eerie, haunting soundtrack the film deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>I, Monster (1971)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/i-monster-1971//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/i-monster-1971/</id><updated>2015-09-18</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/i-monster-1971/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5_vAuJSCJl6_O3CMC1kfX4itw-YsZeHruBCUYIxD4esamQG5Re4SknKkLDA_diB5h3sD1Nl8rz8G=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He would be the most dangerous human being on earth. A monster.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how a learned doctor describes the titular character in &lt;em&gt;I, Monster&lt;/em&gt;. Unfortunately, the script, from Robert Louis Stevenson’s &lt;em&gt;Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde&lt;/em&gt;, doesn’t live up to its own hype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher Lee, sporting an unwieldy hairpiece, plays Marlowe, a psychiatrist in early 20th century England exploring Freud’s theories of the id, ego and super-ego. Marlowe invents a drug that removes the ego and super-ego, leaving only the primal id.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, mostly. At first, the subjects turn primal. Violent, lusty, or terrified. But later, the titular character shows signs of an ego, formulating long term plans and deferring gratification. I’m not sure we’re meant to notice this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. After dosing his cat, and a few of his patients, Marlowe begins experimenting on himself. This brings forth the contemptible Mr. Blake. Marlowe’s transformation is physical as well as mental. The more corrupt and immoral Blake becomes, the more hideous Blake’s visage. It’s not clear how this relates to Freud’s theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time, Marlow’s friend and solicitor Mr. Utterson, played by Peter Cushing, comes to believe Blake is blackmailing Marlowe. Seeking to aid his friend, Utterson investigates Blake, and begins to suspect the unthinkable truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I, Monster&lt;/em&gt; disappoints given its two leads. Lee is magnetic during his transformation scenes, and repulsive yet captivating as Blake. Cushing’s character is little more than a plot device, but he’s still fun to watch. A Jekyll and Hyde story featuring these two shouldn’t be so forgettable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the film shines is in its art direction. Marlowe’s laboratory has a cluttered, lived-in feel that lends atmosphere while avoiding the usual mad scientist tropes. His club sees cultured, well-dressed gentlemen sipping whiskey in overstuffed chairs while discussing professional and philosophical issues. I could almost smell the leather and tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the film doesn’t work. Even at a scant 75 minutes, &lt;em&gt;I, Monster&lt;/em&gt; is too long. There’s just not enough story to sustain a feature length film. Having Marlow inject the serum instead of gulping a potion is a nice touch, but the script doesn’t run with the addiction metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we see characters walking down hallways, walking across rooms, and going up and down stairs. Lots of extraneous shots that add nothing, but seem necessary to pad the running time. Perhaps these bits were part of the abandoned attempt to utilize the Pulfrich effect for 3-D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, one could drop fifteen minutes and have a solid film, but then it wouldn’t be a feature. The studio, Amicus, is best known for their horror anthologies. Films like &lt;em&gt;Dr. Terror’s House of Horrors (1965)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Torture Garden (1967)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-house-that-dripped-blood-1971/&quot;&gt;The House That Dripped Blood (1971)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tales from the Crypt (1972)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/asylum-1972/&quot;&gt;Asylum (1972)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vault of Horror (1973)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;From Beyond the Grave (1974)&lt;/em&gt;. Perhaps they would have done better by shortening &lt;em&gt;I, Monster&lt;/em&gt; and using it in one of them instead.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>Two Evil Eyes (1990)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/two-evil-eyes-1990//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/two-evil-eyes-1990/</id><updated>2015-09-05</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/two-evil-eyes-1990/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FjcmoHWL96rt0VlcxWDqUH1lIA29WIy9UL5Xm7-_aFU=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skip the first half of &lt;em&gt;Two Evil Eyes&lt;/em&gt;. Or at least watch the second half first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film comprises two hour-long segments based on the works of Edgar Allen Poe. The first, directed by George Romero, adapts &lt;em&gt;The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar&lt;/em&gt;. The second, directed by Dario Argento, loosely adapts &lt;em&gt;The Black Cat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar&lt;/em&gt; stars Adrienne Barbeau as Jessica, a woman embezzling her elderly husband’s fortune. Her former lover, Dr. Hoffman, hypnotizes the ailing Ernest Valdemar under the guise of easing his pain. Hoffman then orders the hypnotized Valdemar to sign his assets over to Jessica, who liquidates them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All goes according to plan until Valdemar dies while under hypnosis. Trapped in a hypnotic state, Valdemar’s soul cannot cross over to the land of the dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, Valdemar’s frozen corpse is stalking the two conspirators, shambling around calling Jessica’s name. He does this without moving his mouth, which was a problem for me, but I’ll get to that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romero’s segment has a made-for-TV feel. I can’t identify the exact cause. Perhaps it’s the under-written characters, or the under-furnished sets. Or the flat lighting. Maybe it’s the stiff performances. Or the EC Comics style twist ending. Whatever the reason, Romero’s film could pass for a lost episode of &lt;em&gt;Tales From the Crypt&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not necessarily a bad thing. I loved that show. But, fair or not, one expects more from a feature film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astute viewers will notice a problem with Ramy Zada as Dr. Hoffman. The script tells us he and Jessica were lovers before she married Valdemar, back when she worked as a stewardess. But Zada’s thirteen years younger than Barbeau. Assuming Barbeau was in her early twenties during their affair, that puts Zada at ten years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I can get past that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I couldn’t get past was Valdemar’s ventriloquist act. I couldn’t buy hearing his voice without seeing his mouth move. Romero may have been trying to stay faithful to the source material, but the result feels like what it is: a dubbed-in effect. Worse, it feels unintentional. As though they added it as an afterthought, or because they couldn’t get the prosthetics working right on-set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romero’s script has something to say about greed, but his segment lacks the focus and visceral punch of his better work. The story drags and the ending feels obligatory instead of shocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argento’s entry, &lt;em&gt;The Black Cat&lt;/em&gt; stars Harvey Keitel as Rod (short for Roderick) Usher, a tabloid photographer. We meet him at a crime scene. A woman lies naked on a table, cleaved in half at the waist. Rod snaps pictures of the lurid spectacle while chatting with the detectives investigating the crime. Poking around, he releases a large pendulum blade. We get a dynamic POV shot as the blade arcs down with a roar and embeds itself between the corpse’s halves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the story unfolds, Rod descends into madness culminating in murder. There are some supernatural elements, including the persistent titular feline, but they’re presented as possible figments of Rod’s imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argento piles on the Poe references en route to a Grand Guignol conclusion that’s so over-the-top it’ll make you laugh and gag in the same breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final reveal aside, the film balances atmosphere and gore. Rod’s brownstone has a worn, lived-in feel. The narrow, shadow-filled rooms engender feelings of confinement. The city streets, feelings of isolation and anonymity. The gruesome murders Rod photographs are both inspired by Poe tales. Besides the halved corpse that opens the film, we see one with its mouth wired open after having its teeth pried out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argento’s only outright misstep is Keitel’s wardrobe. Harvey’s a great actor and a good choice, but he should never, ever, wear a beret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to rate the film? &lt;em&gt;Two Evil Eyes&lt;/em&gt; is uneven. Romero’s entry rates two stars, while Argento’s rates four. I split the difference.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>Shock Waves (1977)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/shock-waves-1977//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/shock-waves-1977/</id><updated>2015-08-29</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/shock-waves-1977/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lzLOK11xD98IrAW7Kbn1eyuF8NFIwU6__3tRUlCA9F8=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four survivors planned to hole up in the abandoned hotel’s vault-like refrigerator. It was a good plan, considering the squad of undead, water-breathing Nazi storm troopers lurking outside. Then one survivor gets claustrophobic and fires a signal flare into the refrigerator. That’s where &lt;em&gt;Shock Waves&lt;/em&gt; lost me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film had potential. Early on, John Carradine captains a small sight-seeing boat. On board are his mate, the chef, and four tourists. Carradine holds our interest while the script forces a series of contrived events to strand the boat on a remote island. The most ridiculous of which sees him throw the ship’s navigation system overboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least the island locations look great. The characters trudge through overgrown marshes and watery bogs to discover a crumbling hotel. The filmmakers struck gold here, shooting in an abandoned Biltmore. Its decrepit luxury oozes atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the script’s inanity is taxing. Moving through the hotel, the group discovers an aquarium teaming with exotic fish. Yet, moments later, they seem surprised to find the hotel occupied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Cushing plays the hotel’s lone resident, a morose Nazi living in self-imposed exile. He warns the group to leave the island, even telling them where they can find a boat. Do they listen? Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Cushing and Carradine have roles so minor they’re window dressing, but they’re the best parts of the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, undead Nazis are picking off the stranded visitors. They get a lot of help from the script. A veteran sailor impales his foot on a sea urchin after tromping barefoot through a murky inland stream. Later, five grown men and women lose a sailboat, their only chance at escape, in knee-deep water. After that, the group scatters and one man decides to flee alone down a waist-deep stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nazis themselves are a nameless, nondescript unit of waterlogged storm troopers. We see them rising from the ocean depths, their expressionless faces clad with black goggles. It’s a memorable visual. In part because the film repeats it over and over. Nazis walk into the water. Nazis walk out of the water. Nazis sit up in shallow bogs of water like vampires rising from a coffin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to where &lt;em&gt;Shock Waves&lt;/em&gt; lost me. The four survivors are safe, locked in the hotel’s vault-like fridge. One becomes claustrophobic. He demands to leave. Knowing certain death lurks outside, the others say no. The claustrophobic man becomes enraged. He fires a flare gun into the fridge then flees into the zombie-infested night. The signal flare fills the fridge with smoke and blinds a woman. Rather than allow the smoke to clear, the two other survivors also flee, abandoning the blinded one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The characters in &lt;em&gt;Shock Waves&lt;/em&gt; are so inane, by the end, we’re rooting against them. We can’t connect with them because they don’t behave like human beings. They act like idiots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This alone isn’t a bad thing. One vicarious thrill of horror movies lies in seeing such foolish behavior punished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Shock Waves&lt;/em&gt; disappoints. When claustrophobia guy jeopardizes the lives of everyone with his selfish behavior, we expect to see him offed in spectacular fashion. But his demise consists of a zombie pulling him underwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a shame. Even on an exploitation level, the film doesn’t deliver. The ripe premise, solid production and entertaining turns from Cushing and Carradine deserved better.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>Maniac Cop (1988)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/maniac-cop-1988//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/maniac-cop-1988/</id><updated>2015-08-13</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/maniac-cop-1988/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/r6mAYBecAG9bbhDxOWnkC1NPii0VYhG97oHLPTLJogU=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maniac Cop&lt;/em&gt; is set in New York City. Not the bustling metropolis of today, but the seedy, dangerous cesspool Hollywood liked to conjure during the 70s and 80s. A vicious jungle where street punks, pimps, and pushers lurked around every darkened corner. The film embraces this atmosphere. Everything feels worn, lived-in, and used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story concerns a series of killings perpetrated by a uniformed police officer. The victims aren’t criminals, but random innocent people. The killer frames young beat cop Jack Forrest (Bruce Campbell) for the murders. Grizzled detective Frank McCrae (Tom Atkins) doesn’t buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with Jack’s cop girlfriend, McCrae tracks the killings to former cop Matt Cordell. Cordell was a legend on the force.  A super-cop whose shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later mentality landed him on the wrong side of the law. The only trouble? Cordell died in prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or did he? There’s no explicit supernatural element, but Cordell’s resilience is superhuman. Think Michael Myers from the &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt; franchise. Though one wonders about the scars lacing his face. He recovers from a prison assault that saw him stabbed to a bloody pulp, but a few slashes to the face are a bridge too far? Does his body draw the line at cosmetic wounds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jack soon realizes Cordell is out to kill the mayor and police commissioner. The film feints staging this during the city’s St. Patrick’s Day parade spectacle, but betrays its budget by engineering a car chase to an abandoned warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least it’s an entertaining car chase. The POV shots are reminiscent of Campbell’s friend, director Sam Raimi, who turns up as a newsman introducing the parade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its meager budget, &lt;em&gt;Maniac Cop&lt;/em&gt; is a lot of fun. Perhaps it’s the cast. Campbell never takes himself too seriously, always acting as if he were impersonating a B-movie actor. And Atkins has made a career out of playing the same grizzled, hard-drinking cop. He delivers a conscious, but not condescending, stereotype. Just because the performance is familiar, doesn’t mean it’s any less welcome. Atkins plays McCrae with the perfect amount of gravitas.  His reaction during the scene where Richard Roundtree, as the police commissioner, tells him “You don’t smile very much,” made me laugh out loud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along those lines, director William Lustig injects a streak of black comedy. Consider the scene where Cordell asphyxiates a man in a block of wet concrete. Lustig smash cuts to the following morning as jackhammers work to extract the face-down corpse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;em&gt;Maniac Cop&lt;/em&gt; is not perfect. Cordell’s big reveal is something of a letdown. Robert Z’Dar is fine, but I couldn’t help thinking of Brian Thompson. The bigger problem is Jack’s girlfriend. Despite being a vice cop, she acts like a teenage girl, shrieking at every development. Not what you’d expect from a trained officer familiar with life-threatening situations. I don’t fault actress Laurene Landon. She’s convincing in some scenes and ridiculous in others. This falls on Lustig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, &lt;em&gt;Maniac Cop&lt;/em&gt; is that rarest of B-movies, one made by folks who seem to enjoy the work. Like most horror films of that era, &lt;em&gt;Maniac Cop&lt;/em&gt; got a sequel. Unlike most, this one deserved it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s 1944 and the group has seen its share of action on the European lines. Now, they’re enjoying a break in a bombed-out village near the Siegfried Line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private John Reese, played by Steve McQueen, arrives with orders to join the squad. Reese, a former master sergeant demoted to private for insubordination, wastes little time alienating himself from the rest of the men. Rumors swirl that the squad’s next orders will send them home. The men are giddy. Reese is forlorn. The war has become his life. Later that night, he disobeys orders and heads into town for a drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, of course, the squad doesn’t go home. Orders come through sending them back to the line. Reese brightens. On the line, he’s calm but vigilant. An exemplary soldier. Good thing, because the existing American forces soon withdraw, leaving the squad horribly outnumbered. The men rig up a series of schemes to project an illusion of strength, but the Germans soon discover the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing the undermanned squad can’t withstand the inevitable German assult, Reese pushes for an attack on a German pillbox across the line. This would force the Germans into a defensive position, giving the squad a fighting chance. Reese gets orders to stay put while the acting officer leaves to notify command. Reese disregards these orders and convinces two other squad members to join him in a stealth raid. Acting without orders, the men make their way across the mine-leaden no-man’s land with disastrous results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its troubled production, the film should have been a disaster. Robert Pirosh wrote the script and planned to produce and direct. Once McQueen came aboard, the two clashed over script changes. McQueen wanted the other men’s roles diminished and his beefed up. McQueen got his way and Pirosh walked. The studio installed Don Siegel as director. McQueen’s antics had already alienated him from most of the cast, and he clashed with Siegel and the studio as production went on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, the film works. Unlike the heroic melodrama typical of the genre, &lt;em&gt;Hell Is for Heroes&lt;/em&gt; features a dark, nihilistic undercurrent. During one of the film’s most powerful scenes, a soldier screams “MY GUTS!” while clutching his stomach after getting shot. The performance is gripping. The screams go on. Pain gives way to panic. Mania creeps into the soldier’s voice. It would be painful to watch if there were actual blood. But instead we’re given bloodless wounds and carnage-free explosions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, &lt;em&gt;Hell Is for Heroes&lt;/em&gt; looks like a B-movie. The sweltering northern California woods can only suggest the muddy forests of Germany. During firefights, men stiffen up and fall over to simulate getting shot. Before the climatic battle, we’re shown low-quality stock footage of artillery firing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But McQueen’s performance transcends the shoddy production. He doesn’t say much. Instead, he uses his eyes and body language to show us Reese’s feelings. It’s a riveting turn that’s equal parts cold detachment and tumultuous emotion. Watching the film, one is hard pressed to disagree with McQueen’s insistence that the script focus on him. He carries the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only performer who comes close to matching McQueen is James Coburn. Coburn plays Henshaw, a habitual tinkerer struggling with the destruction inherit in war. His defining scene sees him manning a flame-thrower, fighting back manic laughter as he incinerates a group of trapped German soldiers. It’s a haunting visage that foreshadows the star Coburn would later become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, not all the performances are winners. Nick Adams overplays his part as a Polish refugee. His scenes bleed into melodrama. And Bob Newhart looks lost doing a variation of his standup shtick. But the film overcomes these stumbles to finish strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to multiple accounts, the finale was an accident. The production simply ran out of money and couldn’t shoot any more footage. Yet, it’s the perfect, morally ambiguous, ending to punctuate the film’s madness-of-war message. The men charge forward as the camera zooms in. The war goes on, even as the film comes to an end. The flimsy production and awkward comedy fade in our memory as we’re left to ponder the significance of a single pillbox and all the lives it cost.

There, we meet our protagonist Joy, an anthropomorphic emotion. In voicing Joy, Amy Poehler manages the near-impossible feat of being relentlessly optimistic and perky without ever being annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, Riley’s other core emotions—Disgust, Fear, Anger and Sadness—appear. The group operates out of Headquarters, a Space Needle shaped building at the center of Riley’s consciousness. Using a pastel-infused command-console that looks equal parts Playskool and Apple, they influence Riley’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on, Joy dominates. Disgust, Fear, and Anger provide comic relief. Riley grows from infant to toddler to pre-teen. Outside Headquarters, islands akin to giant amusement parks spring to life. These represent Riley’s personality. They grow as new happy memories are formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an efficient opening act with one misstep. Sadness is frustrating. Her actions feel plot-driven and, compared to Joy, her character arc is shallow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot kicks in when Riley, now age 11, finds herself uprooted by a move to San Fransisco. At first, Joy coaxes Riley to remain positive. But a dilapidated house, frazzled parents, a new school, and a moving van that seems to circumnavigate the globe en-route to San Francisco, take their toll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things get even worse when Joy and Sadness find themselves stranded far from Headquarters. This renders Riley unable to feel either of their respective emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the film shifts to adventure as Joy struggles to get them back to Headquarters. On the way, the pair wander through Riley’s long-term memories and meet her almost-forgotten imaginary friend, Bing Bong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Riley, unable to feel anything but anger, fear and disgust, begins lashing out at her parents and friends. As she does, the islands of her personality crumble and fall away into nothingness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Joy’s desperation to reach Headquarters grows, she and Sadness induce a nightmare involving a giant clown. It’s a sequence that will give a fair number of viewers nightmares of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after, the film offers a scene of unexpected depth. Joy and Bing Bong find themselves in a desolate dumping-ground where memories dissolve into dust. We see images of young Riley laughing and playing with Bing Bong. As these memories dissolve and blow away, Bing Bong himself fades from existence. He accepts his fate with a quiet dignity that belies his goofy exterior. It’s a poignant moment that forces older viewers to acknowledge the loss of innocence inherit in growing up&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s this willingness to tackle complex themes without patronizing the audience that makes &lt;em&gt;Inside Out&lt;/em&gt; an impressive film. Odds are, you’ll think it a wonderful movie. I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, almost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain my objection, I must discuss the ending. Spoiler alert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still here? Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film climaxes with Riley, finally able to feel her emotions, crying and hugging her parents. As she does, the missing islands of her personality spring back into existence. Cut to a short time later. Riley is back to her old self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a film that felt so honest in its depiction of the human condition, this felt disingenuous. For all the drama of the islands of personality crumbling into the void, a simple hug reconstructs them exactly as they were?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where are the consequences?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a chance to show Riley adjusting to the move, but at a cost. Maybe part of her never comes back. Maybe the relationship with her parents is forever altered. Maybe when that island returns it’s different, maybe smaller. Anything but the saccharine, everything’s okay bit of fluff we’re given. Sure, new memories are now mixes of emotions instead of pure joy, but this is peddled as a wholly positive change. Where’s the trade-off?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside Out&lt;/em&gt; drives home the message that growing up means accepting sadness as a part of life, yet it can’t apply that lesson to its own ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story opens three years after the Civil War.  John Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a former Confederate soldier turned drifter who visits his brother’s family on the Texas frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Ethan arrives, Comanches massacre his brother and sister-in-law. After the funeral, Ethan sets off in search of his young niece Debbie, whom the Comanche have taken captive. Accompanying Ethan is Martin Pawley, an orphan Ethan’s brother and sister-in-law raised as their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a daunting task. Director John Ford uses the gigantic mesas of Monument Valley to frame his characters as tiny and alone. Small specs on the vast, unforgiving landscape of the frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the years pass, Ethan’s hatred for the Comanche consumes him. Martin realizes with growing horror that Ethan means to kill Debbie should they find her. Such is Ethan’s unbridled hate for the Comanche, that he can’t bear the thought of her having gone native.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film isn’t all dark. During breaks when the trail goes cold, Ethan and Martin return to a neighboring homestead. There, Martin and a young pioneer girl fumble at flirtation in a series of slapstick events. These bits can be jarring, but they exist to lighten the mood. Without them, the ending would feel disingenuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting aside these comedic interludes, this is Wayne’s movie. He gives a fearless performance. Consider the scene where he meets Martin. While he’s all smiles around his family, when he sees Martin he goes cold. Martin is one-eighth Comanche. In a glance, Ethan identifies him as ‘the other’ and his bitterness bubbles to the surface. In Ethan, Wayne inhabits a disenfranchised, angry man. After battling on the losing side of a war, he longs for validation. In the Comanche he finds an outlet for his rage. Another war to fight. A chance to redeem himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, he’s beyond redemption. The now-famous closing shot illustrates this perfectly. As everyone enters the house, Ethan remains outside. He shifts his weight, watching the joy inside. In his eyes, we see a longing battling the unease. He turns and walks back toward the frontier alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s this refusal to judge or redeem Wayne’s character that makes &lt;em&gt;The Searchers&lt;/em&gt; resonate. Ethan has moments of compassion and heroism, but the film doesn’t allow for a contrived finale that sees him cured of his bigotry. Nor does it paint him as a one-dimensional villain incapable of recognizing his own shortcomings. Instead, we’re left to acknowledge Ethan’s nature and contemplate the role men like him played in the settling of the American West.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: A-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The locals have gathered to burn Elizabeth Selwyn for the crime of witchcraft.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As the flames consume her, Elizabeth pledges her soul to Lucifer in exchange for eternal life. The bloodthirsty villagers drown her out, chanting “Burn witch, burn!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smash-cut to an extreme close-up of Christopher Lee repeating the same line. It&amp;#39;s present day. Lee plays Alan Driscoll, a college professor lecturing a group of young students on the history of witchcraft. In attendance are our heroine, Nan, and her boyfriend Bill. Nan sits in rapt attention, shushing Bill&amp;#39;s snide comments. It&amp;#39;s clear Bill took the course just to hit on Nan. It&amp;#39;s less clear what she sees in him.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the lecture, Nan approaches Professor Driscoll. Nan wants to use her upcoming winter break to write a thesis on witchcraft in New England, but feels she needs some first-hand research. She plans to get a room in the smallest, oldest town in New England she can find. There she’ll comb through the town hall records, recheck the libraries, and interview the puritan descendants. Impressed by her enthusiasm, Driscoll suggests she visit his hometown, a small New England village called Whitewood. Nan agrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill, who’d hoped Nan would spend the break with him, tries to dissuade her, but Nan remains resolute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before long, Nan’s pulling up to a desolate filling station in the dead of night asking for directions to Whitewood. The station attendant tries to warn her away, but Nan dismisses his concern. Armed with directions, she heads out into the fog-covered night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of town, Nan picks up a hitchhiker, played by Valentine Dyall. Dyall’s performance is all ominous menace. When he speaks, it’s as though someone is talking &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Nan finally arrives in Whitewood, we recognize it from the opening sequence. The town drips atmosphere, from the fog-laced streets to the dark, claustrophobic interiors. Nan turns to her passenger who, of course, has vanished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nan checks into the local inn. The proprietor bears an uncanny resemblance to Elizabeth Selwyn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you see where this is going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I venture any further, let me say that the DVD from VCI is under $10 on Amazon. It’s the only way to watch the film. There&amp;#39;s a print streaming on Amazon Prime and I’ve seen a few others floating around on YouTube, but they’re all cropped, scratchy or low resolution. Spend the $9 and change and watch it on a decent up-converting DVD player. It’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the review. At this point, those weary of spoilers should stop reading as I must cover a few plot points to illustrate why the film is so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, despite setting up a predictable plot where Nan gets captured by Elizabeth and rescued by her boyfriend, the film takes a darker turn. The witches of Whitewood lure Nan into the tunnels beneath the inn. They snatch her and drag her screaming into a hidden chamber. They place her on a sacrificial altar, holding her down as she kicks and thrashes. A black robed figure raises a knife over her chest. Nan screams. The knife drives toward her chest as we smash-cut to a knife plunging into a cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nan is dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s quite a narrative surprise, considering she’d been our lone protagonist. Now it’s Nan’s brother, Bob, and Bill who retrace her steps and confront the evil lurking in the village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And remember Professor Driscoll? It’s hinted early that he might be up to no good, but after Nan meets her fate, there’s no doubt left. Driscoll is a wolf in sheep’s clothing, searching for victims to sustain his cursed brethren. Lee plays him with a perfect mix of cultured charm and seething menace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Lee&amp;#39;s performance, like the film, is an overlooked gem. While critics laud Lee&amp;#39;s early work for Hammer productions, this entry by Hammer rival Amicus&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; remains forgotten. It’s a shame, especially considering this film’s combination of contemporary setting and satanic themes foreshadowed the cinematic horror trends that proved to be Hammer’s undoing.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, one could say &lt;em&gt;The City of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; was ahead of its time. That elements like the filling station attendant attempting to warn the unsuspecting strangers, or the red-herring protagonist, have been copied by so many other films they&amp;#39;re now regarded as tropes. But I’ll leave the academia to others. Suffice it to say the film &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A likely inspiration for the witch burning skit in &lt;em&gt;Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_of_the_Dead_(film)&quot;&gt;the article on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, producer Milton Subotsky added the character of Bill when he rewrote George Baxt’s script.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then called Vulcan Pictures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hammer wouldn’t produce a contemporary satanic-themed horror film until &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/to-the-devil-a-daughter-1976/&quot;&gt;To the Devil a Daughter (1976)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, their final film. Meanwhile, films like &lt;em&gt;Rosemary’s Baby (1968)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Exorcist (1973)&lt;/em&gt; made millions at the box office.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref4&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

It’s ridiculous in the best possible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don’t make movies like this anymore. Nowadays, B movies are homogenized, euphemistic, schlock neutered for release on basic cable. The manic energy is gone, along with any sense of pride from the people involved. Instead, we get half-assed camp with D-list performers that can’t disguise their contempt for the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, &lt;em&gt;WolfCop&lt;/em&gt; is a rarity. A lurid pulp creation made by talented folks who seem to be enjoying themselves. You can feel it in every over-the-top minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the transformation scene. A genre staple. Our protagonist, Lou, stumbles drunk into a dive bar bathroom. The change begins as he relieves himself. Lou lets out a howl. His urine turns blood red as his penis sprouts hair and inflates like a trick balloon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a crazy shot, but not gratuitous. In leading with the genitals, WolfCop conveys the character’s transformation pain better than any werewolf film I can recall. I laughed and cringed in the same breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every scene is as calculated. Scenes like WolfCop tricking out his police cruiser, or foiling a gang of graffiti artists by hosing them down with his urine, are just silly. But that’s okay. The film’s only pushing the werewolf genre tropes to their natural extremes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;WolfCop&lt;/em&gt;, it’s not “What if a cop became a werewolf?” It’s “What if a drunken cop stereotype became a werewolf super cop?” The resulting mishmash of cop drama and supernatural horror is a tone-perfect, greasy hamburger of a movie that clocks in at a scant seventy nine minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s face it, the bit about the ballooning penis already told you everything you needed to know, didn’t it?

It&amp;#39;s well-produced, self-aware, and devoid of any disturbing scares or gratuitous thrills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story opens at dusk. A girl half-dressed (but not nude) in high heels flees her suburban home. She runs into the street. Her wide eyes darting back over her shoulder. She pauses, then runs back toward her house. Her father steps outside and asks if she&amp;#39;s okay. She says she is as she runs back inside. A moment later, she&amp;#39;s back out. She gets into her car, backs out of the driveway, and speeds off into the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She stops at a lake and walks down to the water. She sits down with the water at her back and makes a tearful call to her parents. She apologizes for past transgressions and says she loves them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to the morning. The girl lies dead on the beach, her body twisted in a grotesque angle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we meet our protagonist, Jay. She&amp;#39;s a nice girl, living in suburban Detroit. She&amp;#39;s got a younger sister, and a couple of other friends that make up her social circle. She&amp;#39;s been dating a guy named Hugh that she&amp;#39;s pretty sweet on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jay and Hugh go to the movies&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but leave when Hugh catches sight of a woman in a yellow dress. Jay doesn&amp;#39;t see her, but a shaken Hugh insists they leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that night, Jay has sex with Hugh in the backseat of his car. It&amp;#39;s their first time together. Afterwards, Jay lies in the backseat talking to Hugh while he fumbles around in the trunk. He finds what he&amp;#39;s looking for and climbs back into the car behind her. Hugh cuts Jay off mid-sentence by covering her mouth with a rag. Jay struggles, but soon passes out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jay wakes up tied to a wheelchair in a desolate, graffiti-covered parking garage. Hugh paces behind her, his eyes darting around. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not going to believe me,&amp;quot; he begins, &amp;quot;but I need to you to remember what I&amp;#39;m saying.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugh tells Jay something is now following her. It doesn&amp;#39;t run, but it&amp;#39;s always walking in a straight line towards her. If it touches her, she&amp;#39;s dead. It can look like anyone. Someone she knows or a complete stranger. It&amp;#39;s a curse. Someone gave it to him, and now, by having sex with her, he&amp;#39;s given it to her. If the thing gets her, it goes after him again, then right down the line to wherever it started. The best thing she can do now, he says, is to have sex with someone else and pass on the curse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prove his point, Hugh wheels Jay to the edge of the garage. In the overgrown lot below, a half-naked woman shambles toward them. Hugh waits until the thing is almost on top of them before wheeling Jay to his car. They peel out, leaving the thing behind. Hugh dumps Jay on her front lawn, still half-dressed, where her sister and friends find her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing soon comes for Jay at her house. It turns out to be invisible to those not cursed, so her friends are little help as an early warning system. Jay flees to a park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, Jay and her friends retreat to a neighbor&amp;#39;s lake house. The next day, the thing catches up with them. Despite being invisible, the thing manhandles Jay&amp;#39;s friends when they try to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, Jay flees. The film breaks the narrative circle by having Jay crash her car in a cornfield. It&amp;#39;s the same tired trope of the girl tripping while fleeing the monster. She wakes up in a hospital. Realizing she&amp;#39;s in danger, but too injured to leave, Jay has sex with her neighbor, passing the curse. The neighbor turns out to be pretty dim-witted. The thing gets him in a matter of days. Jay flees again and ends up passing the curse to a pair of random strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strangers don&amp;#39;t last long. It’s likely Jay never warned them, but perhaps she tried and they didn’t believe her. Either way, it&amp;#39;s soon back after Jay, but this time her friends have a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They go to the local indoor pool, where Jay wades into the center of the water&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. After some tense waiting, the thing shows up, but refuses to enter the water. Instead, it throws things at Jay. One of her friends produces a handgun. He fires blind at where the creature might be. He wings another of Jay&amp;#39;s friends before putting a bullet in the creature&amp;#39;s head. The thing falls into the pool and dies trying to drag Jay under.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or does it? The film isn&amp;#39;t over. We see Jay having sex with another of her friends. The ambiguous final shot sees the pair walking hand-in-hand while someone approaches from behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, this is a well-produced film dripping with atmosphere. The suburban locales evoke a lived-in feel and the Detroit cityscape reeks of urban decay. There&amp;#39;s no hyper-kinetic editing or gimmicky found-footage. It&amp;#39;s a slow burn. Well, maybe more like a slow singe. Given the script, I&amp;#39;m not sure this film could have been done any better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But about that script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening sequence reveals too much. Consider if we hadn’t seen what happened to the girl waiting by the lake.  Since the creature is only visible to the cursed, the script could have played with the concept of an unreliable narrator. Is the curse real or is Jay having a breakdown? By showing the girl dead in a such a manner, the film loses any ambiguity. The curse is real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing the too-much-information trend, the film then explains the details of the curse. Worse still, it does it all through dialog.  Rule #1 of good storytelling: Show, don&amp;#39;t tell. Rule #1 of good horror: Nothing is scarier than the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if the film cut from Hugh holding the rag over Jay&amp;#39;s mouth to him dumping her on the curb in front of her house. We wouldn&amp;#39;t know what had happened to her. When the creature showed up, we&amp;#39;d imagine the worst. By establishing rules and limitations, the filmmakers made the curse less scary. To borrow the film&amp;#39;s STD metaphor, it&amp;#39;s less like AIDS in the 1980&amp;#39;s and more like herpes today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to the biggest problem of all. Yes this is a horrible curse, but it&amp;#39;s manageable. Hell, the film even seems to admit as much. If the thing just walks, then couldn&amp;#39;t one just fly to someplace like Australia? Judging by the pool incident, it doesn&amp;#39;t like water, which means it probably can&amp;#39;t swim, which means you&amp;#39;re safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while we&amp;#39;re on the subject of nit-picks, I&amp;#39;m not sure when this film is set, but how do these kids not have internet access? Wouldn&amp;#39;t they search online for information about the curse?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, &lt;em&gt;It Follows&lt;/em&gt; offers little genuine horror, and the manufactured sense of dread wears thin well before the finale. Nor does it offer anything in the way of vicarious thrills. Its attempt to subvert slasher tropes only reinforces their value. Without them, there&amp;#39;s nothing to distract us from what’s otherwise a trite premise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nice bit of foreshadowing, the movie playing is &lt;em&gt;Charade (1963)&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a stupid plan. They place various plugged-in electrical items around the pool’s edge. When the thing gets in the water, Jay will somehow get out and they’ll fry it. Putting aside the logic of electrocuting a semi-invisible monster, wouldn&amp;#39;t the pool have GFCI wiring?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I endeavor to describe what a given movie is about, convey a sense of the viewing experience&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and give you an idea of how I felt about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;The Visitor&lt;/em&gt;, I am at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film opens with a blue-eyed Christ-figure telling a story to a group of bald children. The story is about Sateen, an intergalactic criminal who fled to Earth. On Earth, Sateen mutated and developed psychic powers which he used to wreak havoc. Another alien defeated Sateen using an army of birds, but not before Sateen impregnated a slew of Earth women. Those women continued Sateen’s legacy through their children. John Huston then enters the room. He says he’s confirmed Sateen’s latest incarnation is an eight-year-old girl in Atlanta, Georgia. He’ll be leaving at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to Atlanta, where we meet the aforementioned girl, Katy, her mother Barbara, and her mother’s boyfriend Ray. Lance Henriksen plays Ray, continuing the film’s surprising casting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katy is, indeed, pure evil. She’s got a demonic falcon who helps her off a few unfortunate souls who end up on her bad side, including a detective played by Glen Ford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time we learn that Ray is part of a shadowy cabal of Sateen worshippers that want Barbara to bear a son. This son would also possess the powers of Sateen and the cabal could harness them for its own ends. It’s not clear why they can’t use Katy, but this is a minor quibble compared to the rest of the film’s plot holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Huston turns out to be the titular Visitor. He’s God, who’s also an alien, and presumably the one who sent the birds to destroy Sateen originally. He’s not there to kill Katy, but to take her back to his world where he’ll teach her not to be evil. Most of the time though, he hangs out on a skyscraper roof with a cadre of bald interpretive dancers. He gives his name as Jerzy Colsowicz and poses as a baby sitter in order to confront Katy. It’s an odd confrontation. The two play Pong on a giant projection screen and dance around the fact that neither of them is human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shelly Winters plays a nanny hired by Barbara. Her scenes are notable for the instance where she slaps young Katy. According to legend, she really did slap the young girl. Hard. I like to think that it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completing some kind of bizarre casting bingo card, Sam Peckinpah turns up as Barbara’s ex-husband. She visits him for an abortion after the Sateen cabal takes matters into their own hands following Ray’s failure to impregnate Barbara. Unlike John Huston, who appears lucid and sober in his scenes, Peckinpah was allegedly a nightmare to work with and his scenes ended up dubbed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all this seems a little disjointed and bizarre, then I have successfully conveyed a sense of the viewing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horror elements are, at times, gruesome. In a scene that would make Lucio Fulci proud, a bird pecks at Glenn Ford’s eyes, forcing him to crash his car. Other times, they’re laughably stilted. Like when Katy makes a basketball explode on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the film is also, at times, visually striking. An early sequence will get your hopes up. A giant sun fills an orange sky. Two cloaked figures stare each other down across a desert as a sandstorm engulfs them. Scenes like this hint at greatness, but the film can’t string enough of these moments together. It is equal parts fascinating and frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, &lt;em&gt;The Visitor&lt;/em&gt; left me with a strong desire to read a biography of John Huston. If only to understand how the legendary auteur ended up starring in a film so bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Roger Ebert said, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/rogers-little-rule-book&quot;&gt;Roger’s Little Rule Book&lt;/a&gt; “If it is a Pauly Shore comedy, there are people who like them, and they should be able to discover in your review if the new one is down to their usual standard.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The studios contracted performers and paid them a salary. The performers worked five days a week like anyone else. When one film wrapped, they moved to another. Thus, films like &lt;em&gt;Three on a Match&lt;/em&gt; came stock-piled with current and future stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story begins in the fall of 1919. The film sets the time with what&amp;#39;s now a common device, a montage of newspaper headlines.  Jack Dempsey wins the world heavyweight title. Prohibition passes. Woman&amp;#39;s suffrage passes. Then, a smaller article. The New York City schools are set to reopen after summer vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to Public School 64. The camera pans back to reveal a schoolyard teaming with children. Hundreds of them. Were they not twirling about, playing on slides and swings, it would pass for a prison yard. Here, we meet three pre-teen girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary is an exhibitionist. She doesn&amp;#39;t mind her bloomers showing while she&amp;#39;s playing on the swing or the attention it gets from the boys. Much to the chagrin of class-beauty Vivian. When Mary skips class to smoke cigarettes with some boys, Vivian wants to tell on her. She&amp;#39;s dissuaded by studious Ruth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time passes with more headlines. The girls are set to graduate. Ruth is valedictorian. Vivian is voted most popular. Mary’s been in so much trouble, she’s almost held back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the ceremony, Ruth and Vivian talk about their futures. Ruth&amp;#39;s family can&amp;#39;t afford her going to high school, so she&amp;#39;s off to secretarial school so she might get a job. Vivian, however, is off to an exclusive boarding school. They both wonder what will become of Mary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More time passes. It&amp;#39;s 1925 now. The girls are teenagers. Mary, now played by Joan Blondell, is in reform school. Vivian, now played by Anne Dvorak is reading lewd romance novels to her rapt roommates in Miss Jasons School for Young Ladies. Ruth, now played by Bette Davis, toils away in secretarial school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it’s 1930. Mary sits in a beauty parlor getting her hair done. She’s telling her beautician how she ran into Ruth earlier that day and how she hasn’t seen her since their days at Public School 64. Vivian is at the same beauty parlor and overhears Mary’s mention of Public School 64. Reunited, the three women meet for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I love about the pictures of this era. Running just over an hour, they had to be efficient. Here, we get ten years of backstory and characterization in under five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At lunch, the girls catch up. We learn Mary has turned her life around and is now an actress who’s just gotten her first break. Ruth is working as a secretary. Vivian has married a wealthy lawyer and has a three-year-old son. Mary and Ruth envy Vivian. But Vivian is restless and bored with her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some days later, Vivian talks her husband, Robert, into letting her travel with their son to Europe. Robert agrees, but not without some reluctance. The night they&amp;#39;re set to sail, he sees her off. After he leaves, Vivian runs into Mary, who’s now a bona-fide stage star. Mary’s there seeing another friend off. Vivian has the ship&amp;#39;s stewardess watch her son and joins Mary&amp;#39;s party. She drinks and flirts with a young rake named Michael. Before the ship leaves port, Vivian takes her son and debarks with Michael.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, Vivian descends into a drug-and-alcohol-fueled nightmare. We see her strung out on the sofa, while her son, dirty and unwashed, begs for some healthy food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary, feeling responsible, visits Robert and tells him where to find Vivian. Robert reclaims his son and divorces Vivian.  Mary and Robert grow closer. On the day his divorce is final, he asks Mary to become his wife. Mary agrees. Ruth joins the family as a nanny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between, we have the obligatory pre-code shot of a woman putting on her stockings. Here, it’s Bette Davis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Vivian has continued her fall from grace. Michael turns out to be a gambler and the two are now desperate for money to feed their habits. Vivian, waiting outside the same uptown apartment building she used to call home, begs Mary for money. After they burn through that, Michael tries extorting Robert. When that doesn’t work, Michael kidnap’s Robert’s son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for all involved, Michael owes money to a mobster named Ace, played by Edward Arnold. Ace gets wind of the plot and muscles his way in via his henchman Harve, played by Humphrey Bogart. When the heat closes in, Harve leans on Michael to off the kid. Vivian, in a moment of lucidity during her withdrawal haze, saves her son in a startling (and over the top) fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a lot of plot for 63 minutes. This is a good thing. Things move so fast we’re not given much time to consider the insanity. And make no mistake, this movie is nuts. Vivian’s fall from society lady to street-corner junkie plays like a caricature. Mary wastes her school years getting into trouble and ends up a society darling. Vivian spends her life doing what’s expected of her and sees her world collapse the first time she steps out of line. And Ruth, poor Ruth. She works, head down, as hard as she can, only to end up working for Mary. How’s that for a mixed message?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Three on a Match&lt;/em&gt; works despite all the crazy. Or is it because of it? I’m not sure. With a cast this good, one is hard-pressed to care.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But for some folks it may be worth a look. To explain why, I must venture into spoiler territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this fair warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film opens with a murder. We’re looking down a set of stairs into a darkened, deserted nightclub. A man sits playing a piano with his back to us. Another man appears atop the stairs. He has a gun. He sneaks down and creeps across the nightclub floor. There’s a flash of lightning and a crack of thunder from the storm outside. The piano player turns, and the gunman shoots twice. The piano player drops dead. Then we hear footsteps and a woman scream. The gunman whirls towards us and fires. We hear the sound of running and a door closing. The gunman hurries after the mystery woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we&amp;#39;re in a posh high-rise office. Two weeks have passed. The rain hasn’t stopped. The gunman, Johnny, sits on a couch. He pokes at a toy piano, playing the same melody the piano player played before he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learn that Johnny is out on bail. He’s planning to claim self-defense at the trial, but the District Attorney has a witness that could put Johnny away for a long time. Johnny thinks he knows where the witness is hiding and wants her out of the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s your job,” Johnny says to a man sitting in a chair with his back to us. Now, here’s where things get confusing. They know where the witness is hiding, but they don’t know her identity. They have a guess, but they’re not sure. So the mystery hitman’s job is to fly out, rent a car, then go undercover. Mingle with the people and suss out the witness’s identity. Then kill her, but make it look like an accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What a hideout,” Johnny says. “No wonder we couldn’t find it until yesterday. It’s the last place in the world you’d expect anyone to hide.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to Glacier National Park in Montana. We see Matt Hallett, played by Victor Mature, entering the park in a rented car. The guard at the gate spies a gun in Matt’s glove compartment and phones it in to Chief Ranger Joe, played by William Bendix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next half-hour or so, the film plays like a would-be suspenseful mystery. The script tries in vain to make us suspect  Matt as the hired killer. It helps that Mature has a way of talking where his entire body remains motionless except his jaw. It kept reminding me of a ventriloquist’s dummy. Certainly creepy enough to be a believable sociopath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, of course, we know better. This would-be misdirection gives Vincent Price a chance to do what he does best, play a character playing someone else. Here, he plays Paul Adams, a mob hitman playing a nature photographer. Early on, he’s all folksy smiles and good humor, but still comes off as something of a dilettante with a hint of menace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt and Paul both vie for the attention of the witness, Louise, played by Piper Laurie. Given that Louise is the only woman that comes close to fitting the witness’s description in the entire park, I’m not so sure it was such a good place to hide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louise is cordial to Paul, but finds herself drawn to Matt. In between, there’s a sub-plot involving a fugitive Indian and his daughter, an avalanche, and a forest fire.  Most of these diversions exist to exploit the film’s 3D presentation. I suppose they do a decent enough job, but they also give us the impression that Glacier Park is something of a death trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a little before the halfway point, Paul’s true identity is revealed. Though we see it coming, the scene isn’t without a surprise. From here, the film shifts into adventure, as Paul has to kill Louise and flee the park. But despite being a professional killer, he fails to off Louise, and she alerts the park authorities. With all the roads closed, Paul has to flee overground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt, now revealed as a cop working for the New York District Attorney’s office, sets out after Paul. Of course, Louise somehow ends up going with him. There’s some great location photography, and everything culminates in a showdown inside an ice fissure. It’s a scene that would have looked great shot in a real ice cave. Instead, the soundstage artifice is all the more glaring. You’ll be hard-pressed not to laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, &lt;em&gt;Dangerous Mission&lt;/em&gt; is not a good movie. The convoluted script and uneven production values see to that. But fans of Vincent Price should enjoy him here, if only for the outfit he wears for the square-dance scene.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/a-girl-walks-home-alone-at-night-2014//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/a-girl-walks-home-alone-at-night-2014/</id><updated>2015-03-06</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/a-girl-walks-home-alone-at-night-2014/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pu8hbqW6Zeezb3vsEy5OGKE2F0rK6bbD5nUYn2Dqs7-Uzt71trlcHYc1YmlyFG0iX18Npr4CVCIe=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night&lt;/em&gt; bills itself as the first Iranian Vampire Western. This is misleading. Like all good movies, it transcends borders. A more accurate tagline might be “The first Persian language Vampire Western.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film takes place in Bad City, a nightmarish amalgam of urban decay and frontier isolation. It’s a place where the dead lay dumped in dried river beds like so much garbage. Its streets alternate between rows of cookie-cutter homes and desolate alleyways. In the distance, oil rigs pump up and down like crows picking at the dead earth’s skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We follow a group of colorful characters with intersecting stories. There’s Arash, a young man who dresses in white t-shirts and pegged jeans. His prized possession is a 1957 Ford Thunderbird convertible he worked 2,191 days to afford. Arash’s father, Hossein, is a widower and heroin addict. Hossein’s dealer, Saeed has the word “SEX” tattooed across the front of his throat. Saeed is also a pimp for Atti, who’s just turned thirty and dreams of escaping the life of a street walker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weaving through these narratives is the girl. She’s a vampire. She lives in a small, one-room apartment. New-wave posters plaster the walls. At night she emerges in a pitch-black chador to prey on the city’s destitute and depraved. There is a loneliness in her that actress Sheila Vand conveys despite having little dialog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arash and the girl’s paths cross, first in passing then again in one of the film’s cleverest scenes. Arash has been to a costume party and gotten lost walking home. He’s high on Ecstasy, staring open mouthed at a streetlight when the girl spots him. He’s wearing a Dracula costume that prompts something of a double-take by her. Their eyes meet. There is a connection. They sense the loneliness in one-another. In a near wordless scene, she takes him back to her small apartment. She puts on a record and he holds her close, wanting nothing more than the company. It is something out of a teenage fantasy, yet the scene works because the film doesn’t try to sell it. There are no speeches or orchestral swells, just the two performers and the song &lt;em&gt;Death&lt;/em&gt; from White Lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to talk about the ending now. If what I’ve written so far has piqued your curiosity, I encourage you to give the film a look. I’d rather not spoil the ending, but if you’re still on the fence, read on and perhaps I can persuade you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, here? Okay, here we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To appreciate why &lt;em&gt;A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night&lt;/em&gt; is a great film, we must discuss the final scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arash and the girl are driving out of town. Arash doesn&amp;#39;t know that she&amp;#39;s a vampire, but he knows that she killed his father. The girl doesn’t know that the man she killed was Arash’s father, but she knows he’s having second thoughts. They drive in silence. After a bit, Arash pulls the car over. He gets out and paces in the headlights. His fists clench and unclench. He runs his hands through his hair. The emotions wash over him. The girl watches in silence. We don’t fear for him, we fear for her feelings. In a Hollywood production this scene would include a monologue followed by an emotional exchange. Writer-director Ana Lily Amirpour gives us something far more powerful in the silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time Arash straightens, gets back in the car and pulls onto the road. They leave Bad City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a perfect ending, and one that stuck with me long after I’d walked out of the theater. Howard Hawks said that a great movie consisted of “Three good scenes and no bad ones.” &lt;em&gt;A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night&lt;/em&gt; has this and more.

The studio rose to prominence with films such as &lt;em&gt;Curse of Frankenstein (1957)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/horror-of-dracula-1958/&quot;&gt;Horror of Dracula (1958)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Unlike those staged, period pieces, this film is set in contemporary times and shot on location. It represented a big departure for Hammer, but it was too little too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story—ah, well, you’ll have to bear with me here. I’ve seen the movie twice and I’m still not sure about some of the details. According the featurette on Anchor Bay’s DVD, the filmmaker’s were writing the script as they went along. It shows in the final product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As near as I can tell, Father Michael, played by Christopher Lee, is a priest who commits the heresy of putting his faith in man over God. To that end—and here’s where things get fuzzy—he retreats to a compound in Bavaria where he forms his own Satanic religion which masquerades as Catholicism. One of his acolytes dies during childbirth and Father Michael baptizes the baby, a girl, in her dead mother’s blood. The girl, Catherine, grows up as a nun in Father Michael’s compound. On her eighteenth birthday she travels to London. There, Father Michael will baptize her in the blood of a demon creature birthed by another of Father Michael’s acolytes&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, fortunately for humanity, Catherine’s father, Henry, has a change of heart. Henry appeals to occult novelist John Verney, played by Richard Widmark. Verney intercepts Catherine at Heathrow airport. Verney had hoped to get a book out of Henry’s story, but soon realizes the stakes are much higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Father Michael attempts to reclaim Catherine by possessing her. Verney tries to keep her safe. During the tug-of-war we’re presented with a couple of disturbing scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first concerns the birth of the demon creature. Picture a staged, antiseptic facsimile of a young girl&amp;#39;s bedroom. On the bed, a woman prepares to give birth. Strips of white cloth bind her wrists to the headboard and clamp her knees and ankles shut, giving the baby no escape. Arms spread, knees clenched, she lays crucified. Her face glistens with sweat as her back arches and her body spasms from another contraction. Her belly swells. Beside her, Father Michael stands waiting, smiling with eager eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And later, we see one of Catherine’s visions/dreams. We’re looking through her eyes. She’s pregnant and laying on her back. We see her bulging womb. Her legs are open, knees up, in the traditional birthing position. Still through her eyes, we see something crawling up from between her legs. At first glimpse it seems to be a baby, but no, it&amp;#39;s a horrid combination of baby and beast with a monstrous jaw and reptilian eyes. Covered in blood, it writhes between her legs, smearing her thighs and stomach with gore. She reaches down and strokes the creature&amp;#39;s grotesque head. Now her midsection is awash in thick, almost syrupy, blood as she gently pushes the thing back down, between her legs. Still through her eyes, we hear her moan in a mixture of agony and ecstasy as she forces the monstrosity &lt;em&gt;back up into her womb&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality of the creature effects in this scene is laughable. And what’s worse the scene has little to do with the story. Instead, it feels like something tacked on as a reaction to &lt;em&gt;Rosemary’s Baby (1968)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Exorcist (1973)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s when you compare this film to those, that one realizes how far Hammer had fallen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a studio that, nineteen years prior, had revived the horror genre by injecting a liberal dose of gore and sex into the monster movie. The resulting films were edgy and fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But time passed. Those kids who flocked theaters for Hammer’s earlier films now had kids of their own. To this new generation, Hammer’s period monster movies were passé. They were your &lt;em&gt;parent’s&lt;/em&gt; horror movies. Even this wave of satanic themed films was on it’s nadir. Two years later &lt;em&gt;Halloween (1978)&lt;/em&gt; would usher in the slasher genre that would dominate horror for the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time Hammer woke up and tried to tap into the mainstream horror pulse, it lacked the resources to pull off a competent film. Christopher Lee does his best, but Richard Widmark looks tired and annoyed. He’s just cashing a paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part is the ending. Remember how I said they were writing the script as they went along? As it turns out, they ran out of money by the time they got to the end. After an hour and a half of buildup, Verney and Father Michael square off in a mausoleum. Father Michael stands in a large circle made of blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Says Verney, “You really think this circle will protect you, don’t you? It won’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But it will,” says Father Michael. “Because this circle stands upon a hill of flint, and flint is the sacred stone of Astaroth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verney holds up a rock he literally just picked up five minutes earlier and used to club one of Father Michael’s henchman. “But this sacred stone of Astaroth has the blood of your disciple on it. Now, the demons will protect me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verney steps into the circle and throws the rock at Father Michael, hitting him on the head. Father Michael falls to the ground and disappears. Movie over. That’s the ending. A mumbo-jumbo bit of rock-paper-scissors involving flint and the blood of a disciple. Two bits of information &lt;em&gt;never mentioned in the film before&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this was the best Hammer could do, then the studio’s death was a mercy killing&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the studio was resurrected in 2008.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m willing to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume Father Michael wasn’t doing this for Satan, but for his own gain. That he’s somehow brought about the birth of a demon and by baptizing Catherine in its blood, he could control its power. I know that’s reaching, but I’ve got a soft spot for Hammer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so the studio didn’t &lt;em&gt;die&lt;/em&gt;, it just produced television instead of movies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

</content></entry><entry><title>The Long Night (1947)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-long-night-1947//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-long-night-1947/</id><updated>2015-02-26</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-long-night-1947/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1z94bhIshDI1Tc2ghru9TQsP3Rlkldgghd_kcdE3wbwlvd-S4iAJ8AlaheqztYZeF3xgAG3xYgis=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Long Night&lt;/em&gt; starts well, only to lose its way in the third act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story opens with a murder. We’re inside an apartment building on the working-class side of the tracks. We hear gunshots. A man staggers out of a unit holding his gut and tumbles down the stairs. The police arrive. They attempt to extract the shooter. Through a door, the shooter says he wants to be left alone. We recognize the voice as Henry Fonda’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through flashbacks, we learn that Henry Fonda plays Joe, a veteran recently returned from World War II. He’s a wholesome guy. He drinks milk and uses exclamations like, “No kidding!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, while working as a sandblaster at the local plant, Joe meets a young girl named Jo Anne, played by Barbara Bel Geddes. Joe and Jo Anne hit it off. The film would have us believe this is natural since they’re both orphans and they’re both named Joe. They begin dating. Joe falls hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night, Jo Anne cancels a date with Joe. She has something to do. Joe says that’s fine, but takes Jo Anne’s favorite stuffed animal hostage as a bit of insurance that she’ll see him again. It’s a nice touch that gives Joe some edge and helps make the film’s later events more plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe ends up tailing Jo Anne to a dingy club where a magician is performing. Vincent Price plays the magician. We recognize him as the man who was shot during the film’s opening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the bar, Joe meets Charlene, played by Ann Dvorak. Through Charlene, we learn the magician’s name is Maximilian. Charlene was one of his assistants. She’s just now decided to leave him, having grown tired of his manipulative ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe watches Jo Anne. She seems enraptured by Maximilian’s performance and approaches him after the show. Maximilian’s tells her to meet him at his table. Joe’s seen enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before joining Jo Anne, however, Maximilian approaches Joe and Charlene at the bar. It’s here we get our first taste of Maximilian’s condescending wit. He tries to cajole Charlene into changing her mind. Joe tells Maximilian to scram. Maximilian replies with a sarcastic grin, “My friend, there is no one I would like disagreeing with more than you. However, under the circumstances, there’s hardly any point in continuing our conversation.” Then, to Charlene, “Till tomorrow, my dear.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlene develops a torch for Joe. Joe, feeling hurt by Jo Anne, uses Charlene for companionship. She’s more or less emotional collateral damage by the film’s end. Dvorak makes the most of a part that exists only to show Joe turning to the dark side when he thinks he’s lost Jo Anne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the story goes on, we learn the depths of Maximilian’s debauchery. How he’s seduced and manipulated countless naive young girls like Jo Anne. Each new bit of knowledge cuts at Joe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all builds to a showdown between Joe and Maximilian. The confrontation doesn’t disappoint. Price is great in the part despite being a decade too young. Like all of Price’s best roles, he plays a showman, one capable of immense charm on stage, and immense debauchery off stage. He talks circles around Fonda, each word dripping with condescension. Fonda plays on this, his frustration building and building until it boils over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to where we came in. And here’s where movie goes wrong. The tone shifts from noir to populist drama. The town rallies around Joe in his standoff with the police. Jo Anne fights through a never-ending mob in an effort to reach Joe. She’s knocked down by someone carrying a bicycle. Won’t the police please just let her talk to Joe, she pleads. But they won’t. Which leads to more shots of Jo Anne fighting her way through the crowd. As if this all weren’t bad enough, the film closes on a cornball line. As he’s escorted out by the police, Joe asks one of the crowd for a light. The man lights Joe’s cigarette and asks, “How you doing, Joe?” Joe replies, “I think we’ll make it, Freddy. Just about make it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No Joe, not with a disingenuous ending like that, you won’t.

We’re never told how he got this nickname. The film is full of superfluous bits like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eggsy lives with his mother and infant sister in one of London’s ailing housing projects. His father died when he was just a toddler. These days, his mother has taken up with a low-level hood who degrades her and bullies Eggsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a rare moment of defiance lands Eggsy in jail, Eggsy calls a mysterious number his mother gave him should he ever find himself in trouble. Shortly thereafter, Eggsy walks out of jail a free man. Outside the police station, Eggsy meets Harry Hart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry, played by Colin Firth, is a dapper gentleman cut from the David Niven cloth. The two go for a pint. Harry tells Eggsy that Eggsy’s father was a Kingsman, a member of an elite group of gentleman super-spies. He died saving Harry’s life. Eggsy is incredulous until he sees Harry take down a group of young thugs using nothing but an umbrella. Before he leaves, Harry offers Eggsy a chance to try out for the Kingsmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so Eggsy goes to spy-school. In keeping with the dapper gentleman theme, spy-school is more like boarding school than boot camp. When they&amp;#39;re not practicing with sniper rifles or parachuting out of planes, the fresh-faced recruits wear uniforms resembling flannel suit pajamas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, every spy story needs a super villain. Here we’re given Richmond Valentine, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Valentine is an internet billionaire who speaks with a lisp, hates the sight of blood, and dresses like a teenager. Convinced mankind is a virus doomed to destroy the planet, Valentine plans to wipe out eighty-five percent of the human race. Naturally, he’ll pick the fifteen percent that will survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And every super villain needs a colorful henchman. Valentine has Gazelle, a double leg amputee whose prosthetics also act as swords capable of slicing a man in half. Spoiler alert: she slices someone in half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the film builds to the inevitable confrontation between Eggsy and Valentine, it becomes increasingly ludicrous. Gazelle dismembers an armed cadre of elite security officers. Harry single-handedly kills a church full of people. Eggsy picks off Valentine’s henchman while somersaulting through the air in slow motion. Heads explode in a rainbow spray of gore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, it&amp;#39;s silly, but the juxtaposition of the mild mannered Firth and the comical violence leaves the film with nowhere to go but over-the-top. There&amp;#39;s even a scene between Firth and Samuel L. Jackson where they have a black-tie dinner consisting of Big Macs. I can&amp;#39;t imagine anyone but Firth pulling that off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But casting Firth is not without its downsides. With someone like Clive Owen, the film could have gone with a more serious and cynical tone. The script flirts with having something to say about elitism and class hierarchy, but it’s lost amid the silliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, the film is full of superfluous bits. There are characters with no payoff. Roxy, another Kingsmen recruit seems to exist only to make Eggsy seem nicer than the other male recruits. She&amp;#39;s an afterthought by the time we reach the finale. And then there are the plot holes. Like how an ultra secret organization allows most of its recruiting class to walk away after failing to make the cut. Or how an intelligence organization like the Kingsmen doesn’t have its own satellites. This is sloppy storytelling, but one is hard-pressed to care given the film’s relentless spectacle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, &lt;em&gt;Kingsman: The Secret Service&lt;/em&gt; is little more than an adolescent male super-spy fantasy. That said, it’s not bad. It&amp;#39;s a throwback to the days when James Bond seemed to relish his job and the films favored adventure over angst. It may not be a great film, but it sure is entertaining.

This is one of those films where the hero takes the entire movie to deduce what the audience figures out in the first ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film opens with doctor Jeff Cameron treating a little girl. Jeff is telling her a story about elephants. Robert Mitchum plays Jeff. He’s miscast in a part that would better suit Henry Fonda, but that’s the least of the film’s problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing with the little girl, Jeff clocks out, eager for  his date with Julie, a nice nurse who works at the hospital. But Jeff has to cancel after he&amp;#39;s called to assist with a new patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patient is Margo, a not-so-wholesome girl who’d just attempted suicide. Jeff treats Margo, then the two start dating. He falls hard. Faith Domergue plays Margo. Like Mitchum, she’s miscast. But unlike Mitchum, it’s hard to overlook just how wrong she is for the role. To be fair, it’s a hard part to play.
Margo has to do more than seduce Jeff, she has to seduce the entire audience. We have to buy Jeff overlooking a myriad of red flags and throwing his life away for a woman he just met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we don’t buy it. The entire romance is unconvincing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon Margo breaks it to Jeff that she has to leave for Nassau. It seems her father has come home, and upon finding out about Jeff, decided it best that Margo take a trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff doesn’t take it well. He has a few too many and goes to Margo’s house. He confronts her father, Mr. Lannington, played by third-billed Claude Rains in his only scene. Here, Jeff discovers the first of many things we already suspected. Lannington isn&amp;#39;t her father at all, but her husband!&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff and Lannington get into a scuffle. Jeff knocks down Lannington who gets back up and pummels Jeff with a fireplace poker. Jeff clocks Lannington, knocking him out cold. Jeff, still reeling, stumbles to the bathroom for some water. When he returns, Margo tells Jeff that Lannington is dead.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, at this point it&amp;#39;s obvious to us that Margo killed her husband while Jeff was out of the room. But, since the rest of the film hinges on Jeff believing he did it, a series of contrived plot machinations are necessary. As the film rolls on the pair will ”just miss&amp;quot; the news. The car radio won’t work. Someone will draw a beard on Margo’s police picture, preventing her from being recognized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Margo convinces Jeff to make a run for the Mexico border. Jeff agrees. The film explains this by having Jeff tell us he has a concussion. This is the worst concussion you&amp;#39;ve ever seen. Jeff blacks out, loses the ability to think straight, and by the time the film&amp;#39;s predictable conclusion rolls around, finds the left side of his body paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here the film shifts to a road movie. Margo and Jeff prowl through the small, out-of-the-way towns of the southwest and descend into a kind of backwoods hell. In one town they’re nearly thrown in jail after a fender-bender with a drunken immigrant. In another they’re brought before the town sheriff for being clean shaven during “Whiskers Week.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the film tells us that Margo is crazy. It’s played as a big reveal, but we’ve known it all along. After all, didn’t Jeff meet her because she’d tried to commit suicide?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything wraps up near the Mexico border. Jeff and Margo are holed up in a dingy hotel room. Margo reveals she’d been stashing Lannington’s money in a Mexican bank. Jeff finally realizes that Margo killed Lannington. Margo smothers Jeff with a pillow and heads for the border. She’s almost across when she sees Jeff shambling down the street toward her. She begs him to stop, to not come any further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domergue doesn’t look like a desperate woman, she looks like an actress unsure of what to do. “Don’t make me shoot,” she says to no one as she pulls a small revolver from her purse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff keeps coming. Margo shoots and misses. The border guards shoot Margo, who dies, but not before confessing to the authorities that she killed Lannington alone. Jeff wakes up in a hospital. He’s going to be okay. Julie is there waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where Danger Lives&lt;/em&gt; isn’t as awful as it is frustrating. The film treats us like simpletons, expecting us to swallow one trite plot twist after another while ignoring Domergue’s stilted performance. I tried, but I just couldn’t do it. Maybe a concussion would have helped.&lt;/p&gt;

This is evident from the opening scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A droning hum whines in and out as a young man named Peter Manning stands wearing a suit. He looks dazed. In front of him, a nude woman suffers a whip while lying strapped to a table. Men in black robes look on. One has a goat. Wearing a large headdress complete with ram horns, a green-skinned Barbra Steel introduces herself as Lavinia, the &amp;quot;Keeper of the Black Secret”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. She asks if Peter knows why he&amp;#39;s there. He does. She asks if he&amp;#39;s ready to sign. He is. A man brings over a large book and Peter signs his name. Then Lavinia hands Peter a dagger. Peter stabs the girl on the table. There&amp;#39;s a quick-cut to the goat, which seems distressed. Lavinia snaps her fingers. There&amp;#39;s a crack of thunder. A muscular man dressed in a leather bikini bottom, leather arm-bands, and a studded leather cap sprouting deer antlers brings over a branding iron which he presses into Peter&amp;#39;s chest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that happens. The film packs a few more of these trippy, S&amp;amp;M-tinged sequences, but they exist more-or-less outside the main narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story concerns Peter&amp;#39;s brother, Robert, played by Mark Eden. When Peter doesn&amp;#39;t return home, Robert goes looking for him at his last known location, a remote country estate called Craxton Lodge. Robert&amp;#39;s arrival coincides with a local festival celebrating the burning of the witch Lavinia some three hundred years earlier. The estate’s owner, J.D. Morely, played by Christopher Lee, claims to have never heard of Peter, but invites Robert to stay on to continue his search. Robert agrees. Robert also meets another of the locals, Professor Marsh, played by Boris Karloff. Marsh, conveniently, is an expert on witchcraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the film unwinds, the tone veers between cult conspiracy and Scooby-Doo mystery. Robert discovers secret doors and a fake spiderweb machine en-route to learning the truth behind his brother’s disappearance. But by the time the credits roll we&amp;#39;re left wondering if the scenes with Lavinia were meant to be real or imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes ambiguity helps a film resonate. But in this case, it only serves to underscore the film&amp;#39;s patronizing approach to its horror elements. Consider the poor attempt at meta-humor. When one of the characters compares Craxton Lodge to “one of those old houses in horror films,” Robert replies, “It’s like Boris Karloff’s going to pop up at any moment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my first viewing of &lt;em&gt;The Curse of the Crimson Altar&lt;/em&gt; , I considered it something of a guilty pleasure. The over-the-top dream sequences and gratuitous nudity were good for a chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But watching it a second time, I found the film far less entertaining. Sure, Karloff is great. Even wheelchair-bound at eighty-years-old, he could still command a scene. But that’s about all this movie has going for it. Lee’s role gives him little to do, and Barbara Steele is wasted. The story’s mystery elements, already weak on the first viewing, border on tedious the second time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that this was one of Karloff’s final films, it’s probably required viewing for any serious fan of classic horror. Just don&amp;#39;t watch it a second time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It talks about how those killings formed the basis for the original film, &lt;em&gt;The Town That Dreaded Sundown (1976)&lt;/em&gt;, which screens every Halloween somewhere in Texarkana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film opens on one of those screenings. It&amp;#39;s a drive-in. The camera pans down to a teen couple sitting on the hood of a car. He seems into the film, but she looks uneasy. She says it’s not her kind of movie. He asks her if she wants to go. She does, and they head out. As they leave, the camera picks up a preacher imploring the patrons to remember that people really died back in 1946.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The couple head out for a quiet, deserted area where they can be alone. He makes small talk as they drive. The camera shows them at a tilted angle. It&amp;#39;s an on-the-nose gimmick that foreshadows one of the film&amp;#39;s biggest weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon they&amp;#39;re parked. They start kissing, but the girl spots a man in the nearby woods. He&amp;#39;s dressed just like the killer from the movie. But this is no prank. The man breaks the car&amp;#39;s window with the butt of a revolver. He orders them out of the car at gunpoint, then forces the girl to turn around while he stabs the boy to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we&amp;#39;re off and running. By genre definitions, the film is a slasher, but I&amp;#39;m always hesitant to use that term. For many people, that equates to the &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt; series of films, which were, for the most part, more monster and survival-horror films than slasher. &lt;em&gt;The Town That Dreaded Sundown&lt;/em&gt; is more of a violent mystery. Victims are stalked and murdered in a brutal but stylish manner and we work along with the protagonist to deduce the killer&amp;#39;s identity from a number of suspects. To that end, &lt;em&gt;The Town That Dreaded Sundown&lt;/em&gt; may be the first rural giallo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot to like. The supporting cast includes Edward Herrmann as the aforementioned preacher, and Gary Cole as a sheriff’s deputy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script’s meta-sequel approach works well. It avoids the trap of aggrandizing the original film by regulating it to well-researched pulp entertainment. Granted, this film does play as something of a remake, but by excising the original’s head-scratching bits of comic relief, this entry crafts a much taunter narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the film is far from perfect. Remember the gimmick shot I mentioned earlier? The movie is full of them. Some of them work, but their impact is lost in the shuffle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the scene, set at night, where a woman flees the killer into a huge wheat field. The killer has a gun. He fires and she drops to the ground amid the wheat. He approaches, but can’t find the body. Cut to a bird’s eye shot of the field and we see the woman crawling away from the killer as he stalks forward. They’re not more than six feet apart, but they can’t see each other. The shot’s only held for a few moments before we cut back to a tight shot of the killer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? That was a great shot. Keep it. Cut the music. Just give us the sound of the wind and let us watch from above as she crawls, hoping against hope that he doesn’t see her. Their meeting is inevitable, but the tension would have been palpable watching the two skew towards one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before we get to that, let me say that I liked the movie. The location photography, colorful supporting cast, and competent script make for a solid little slasher. So, having said that, and having given you a sense of what the film is about and what it’s like, I feel my job as reviewer is done. If you want to stop reading here, I’ll understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still with me? Okay. I didn’t love the ending. I didn’t hate it either. It felt like a missed opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s why. The script touches on the notion of violence inspired by the media several times, but only in passing. I felt the film was building to something however, and when the heroine makes to leave town with her grandmother, it struck me. What if this is the end of the movie? She leaves and the killer is never caught. The end. All the bits about inspired violence coalesce into a biting commentary. The killer will be there as long as he has an audience. It would even dovetail nicely with the original&amp;#39;s ambiguous ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, some folks would hate it, but I bet a lot of theater-goers hated the original’s ending too. And yet, that ending helped the original resonate enough to inspire a remake almost forty years later.

Aboard an ocean liner that&amp;#39;s just docked in Veracruz, Mexico, William Bendix bursts into Robert Mitchum&amp;#39;s cabin holding a gun. He&amp;#39;s after something he believes Mitchum stole. Mitchum says he doesn&amp;#39;t have it. “You’ve got the wrong man,” Mitchum says. Bendix isn’t buying it. He moves to arrest Mitchum. Mitchum overpowers Bendix, knocking him out. Mitchum takes Bendix&amp;#39;s gun and identification. The identification reads: Captain Vincent Blake of the US Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After debarking, Mitchum crosses paths with Jane Greer. It&amp;#39;s a short meeting, as Mitchum has to duck out of sight as Bendix emerges from the ship. Once the coast is clear, Mitchum tries to catch a cab, only to find Greer has gotten the last one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to a room inside the Hotel Mexico. We see Patric Knowles packing. He’s in a rush. His eyes are darting around. There&amp;#39;s a knock at the door. Knowles pulls a gun and moves to the side of the door, ready to plug whoever comes in. Then we hear Greer&amp;#39;s voice, telling him to open up. We learn that Knowles is Greer&amp;#39;s fiancee. But she&amp;#39;s not there to marry him, she&amp;#39;s there because he ran off with her savings, about two thousand dollars. She wants it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowles tries to sweet talk her, but Greer cuts him off saying, &amp;quot;The last time you did that it cost me my bank account.&amp;quot; Knowles tries to make her feel bad for harping on him about the money saying, &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s that dollar sign again.&amp;quot; But Greer snaps back, &amp;quot;Where? I don&amp;#39;t see it. Come on, hand it over.&amp;quot; Then, dripping with sarcasm, &amp;quot;I was saving that money for my trousseau.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowles gives Greer the slip, and a few beats later we learn that Mitchum is after Knowles too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the film is set. It’s one big chase. Bendix chases Mitchum who, along with Greer, chases Knowles. Mitchum and Greer form an uneasy partnership as they travel across the Mexican countryside from Veracruz to Tehuacán&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  As the story unfolds we learn what was stolen, and who did the stealing. Mitchum and Greer warm to each other. Everything culminates in a surprising, but satisfying finale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On paper, it&amp;#39;s another forgettable lower-budget entry from RKO, the once premier studio that had fallen to disarray under Howard Hughes. But thanks to a crackerjack script, &lt;em&gt;The Big Steal&lt;/em&gt; is better than it probably had any right to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider how little information we&amp;#39;re given as the movie begins. Rather than open with a flashback or exposition, we’re thrown right into one unnamed man confronting another over an event we know nothing about. That’s great storytelling. But it’s when Greer confronts Knowles that the script really sparkles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s refreshing to see such an independent female character. She&amp;#39;s self assured without being arrogant. Insistent without being whiny. The script may leave the fisticuffs to the men, but Greer&amp;#39;s character holds her own in the numerous bouts of verbal sparring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script also does a great job of subverting our expectations. From the anything-but-inept Mexican police inspector, to Greer—not Mitchum—being the one to get them out of various jams, the script defies the genre’s conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And topping it all off, there&amp;#39;s a nice touch where Mitchum actually wears some of the results of his tussles. From a bloody nose to a beaten face, the film’s fights have visible consequences. Something all too rare in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, it&amp;#39;s not a perfect film. The extended car chase feels tacked on and forced. And Knowles and Bendix don&amp;#39;t quite hold their own against Mitchum and Greer in terms of star wattage. But really, these are weaknesses instead of faults. &lt;em&gt;The Big Steal&lt;/em&gt; takes a B-movie plot and elevates it to near greatness thanks to a well-crafted script peppered with crackling dialog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They actually shot in Mexico, which helps to belie the film’s modest budget.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B-&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When he&amp;#39;s told the innkeeper is unavailable due to his ill wife, an annoyed Rasputin marches upstairs. He storms into the bedroom, and proceeds to &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; the disease out of the frail woman, drawing it into his now red-hot hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dancing and merriment follow. Rasputin gets good and drunk and takes the innkeeper&amp;#39;s daughter out to the barn. This doesn&amp;#39;t sit well with her young suitor who brawls with Rasputin. Rasputin chops the young lad&amp;#39;s hand off saying, &amp;quot;He won&amp;#39;t trouble us anymore,&amp;quot; then makes to get back with the daughter. But the wounded suitor brings the rest of the village, who chase Rasputin out of town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great introduction. If only the rest of the film lived up to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the story unfolds, Rasputin travels to Saint Petersburg. There he insinuates himself into the Tsaritsa&amp;#39;s court by hypnotizing one of her ladies-in-waiting. Barbara Shelley plays the lady in question. There&amp;#39;s a good bit where Rasputin, having just hypnotized Shelley&amp;#39;s character into sleeping with him, tells her to leave some money on the dresser. As Rasputin&amp;#39;s influence grows, members of the court begin to conspire against him. There&amp;#39;s an overly elaborate plot involving poison, some grappling, then it&amp;#39;s all over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a terrific performance by Lee, and Hammer&amp;#39;s solid production values&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the film underwhelms. It treats the character of Rasputin as a one-dimensional monster. This wouldn’t be so bad, but the talky script vacillates between biographical drama and horror without committing to either.  The result? Rasputin spends too much time drinking and dancing and not enough time chopping off hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in 1929, the story opens with the dashing Duke de Richleau awaiting the arrival of his good friend, Rex Van Ryn. The Duke is played by Hammer stalwart Christopher Lee who, in a rare change of pace, gets to play the hero and does a fine job of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rex arrives piloting his own biplane, which is the extent of the characterization the script allots him.  After landing, he and the Duke set out to call on their young friend, Simon. What they find upon arriving at Simon&amp;#39;s palatial house alarms the Duke. It seems Simon has fallen in with a group of Satanists led by the sinister Mocata, played by Charles Gray. As the Duke says, “Simon is playing the most dangerous game known to mankind.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lee’s dialog is full of lines like that. They should induce groans, but Lee pulls them off with flair. He opens the commentary track on the DVD saying that he’s largely responsible for the film being made. He was a big fan of the novel by Dennis Wheatley and brought the book to the attention of studio executives. His performance is reminiscent of Peter Cushing’s turn as Van Helsing in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/horror-of-dracula-1958/&quot;&gt;Horror of Dracula (1958)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and his admiration of the source material shines through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opposite Lee, Gray delivers a smooth, understated performance that’s almost as magnetic as Lee&amp;#39;s&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Consider the scene where he calls on the Duke&amp;#39;s niece in an attempt to extract Simon. She makes to throw him out, but he leaves of his own accord saying, “I&amp;#39;m leaving. I shall not be back. But something will.” He pauses for a moment then adds, “Tonight. Something will come for Simon and the girl.” His tone is casual, not threatening, and all the more menacing for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the supernatural elements, &lt;em&gt;The Devil Rides Out&lt;/em&gt;  isn’t really a horror movie at all&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It’s a terrific pulp adventure. Sure, the characters are archetypes, and the stilted dialog may induce a wry smirk, but the film rolls along at such a good clip, we’ve hardly a moment to care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gray had just starred in &lt;em&gt;You Only Live Twice (1967)&lt;/em&gt; but Hammer&amp;#39;s first choice for Mocata was another Bond alumnus: Gert Fröbe, Goldfinger himself!&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fearing moviegoers would think &lt;em&gt;The Devil Rides Out&lt;/em&gt; was a western, Twentieth Century Fox changed the title to &lt;em&gt;The Devil&amp;#39;s Bride&lt;/em&gt; for the USA theatrical release.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s not possible to talk about &lt;em&gt;The One I Love&lt;/em&gt; in a meaningful way without them. But it’s a movie best seen with an open mind. So I encourage you, if you haven&amp;#39;t seen it, to do so. It&amp;#39;s not perfect, but the first two acts are brilliant and it&amp;#39;s original enough to warrant a look. Go ahead, I&amp;#39;ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back? Okay, here we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Duplass and Elisabeth Moss play Ethan and Sophie, a young couple on the brink of divorce. They&amp;#39;ve drifted apart. Their counselor sends them to a remote retreat for a weekend getaway. He believes it’s just what they need to reconnect and rediscover one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The retreat turns out to be a sizable country estate, complete with pool and guest house. Ethan and Sophie arrive and discover they&amp;#39;re the only people present. They settle in, have a nice dinner, and smoke some marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sophie wanders over to the guest house.  Ethan joins her. They laugh, talk and have a wonderful time. The best they&amp;#39;ve had in years. They have sex. Later, Sophie heads back to the main house to grab some things. Inside, she&amp;#39;s surprised to find Ethan lying on the couch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She laughs and asks how he&amp;#39;s beaten her back. Ethan looks confused. He&amp;#39;s just woken up. Sophie stops laughing. She asks him why he&amp;#39;s acting like this after they just has sex. Ethan looks at her with bewilderment. He tells her he&amp;#39;s been asleep on the couch since they smoked the marijuana. Sophie storms off, furious at Ethan&amp;#39;s unfunny joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethan wanders over to the guest house and falls asleep on the couch there. In the middle of the night, Sophie joins him. They snuggle. Ethan wakes to find Sophie making breakfast. Including bacon. Sophie hates bacon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to this point, the film has cultivated a subtle aura of menace. The long shadow-filled shots of Sophie walking back to the house and through the empty kitchen wouldn&amp;#39;t seem out of place in a home invasion thriller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now we&amp;#39;ve got an inkling of what&amp;#39;s going on, and to the film&amp;#39;s credit, it doesn&amp;#39;t drag things out.  Ethan and Sophie soon realize that when one of them enters the guest house alone, they&amp;#39;re greeted by a doppelgänger of the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They run. Again, credit to the film. It&amp;#39;s what most folks would do. But then Ethan and Sophie get to thinking about it. Especially Sophie. They talk. The film&amp;#39;s tone shifts from menacing to quirky. Sophie suggests going back. Weren&amp;#39;t they there to try new things? Ethan agrees. They return to the retreat and set some ground rules for the guest house. Fifteen minute sessions, no intimate activity. Total honesty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these rules soon go out the window. Sophie begins sneaking out to see the other Ethan. Ethan ends up impersonating his doppelgänger in order to sleep with Sophie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, Ethan gets some voicemails from friends and family members. The messages suggest that Ethan made a series of calls in the middle of the night asking random questions about his past. Some of his clothes seem to have gone missing as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon the doppelgängers confront Ethan and Sophie as a couple. The four try to have a nice dinner, but Ethan&amp;#39;s suspicion and resentment bubble over. He storms off to the guest house. Once inside, he finds he can&amp;#39;t get out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time, Sophie&amp;#39;s doppelgänger arrives. Then the film falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to this point, the doppelgängers felt like a novel device the script employed to visualize Ethan and Sophie&amp;#39;s perceptions of one another. This sort of thing could feel like a gimmick and veer into into cheesy fantasy, but the film stays grounded by focusing on the harsh realities of trying to make a relationship work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, the doppelgängers require no explanation. They exist to serve the story. The film even floats this notion, suggesting that some things “Just happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the movie isn&amp;#39;t confident enough to leave it at that. And so Sophie&amp;#39;s doppelgänger reveals the truth to Ethan. Her and Doppelgänger Ethan were another couple sent to the retreat like Ethan and Sophie, but now they&amp;#39;re trapped. The only way they can leave is to break up Ethan and Sophie so they can take their place. But something&amp;#39;s gone wrong. The other Ethan has fallen in love with the real Sophie. He&amp;#39;s planning to leave with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that wealth of exposition, the plot kicks in. Doppelgänger Sophie lets Ethan out of the guest house and distracts Doppelgänger Ethan (by posing as the real Sophie) so that Ethan can warn Sophie. When Sophie refuses to leave with him, Doppelgänger Ethan tries leaving by himself. An invisible wall knocks him cold. Ethan and Sophie leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next we see, they&amp;#39;re lying in bed giggling. Sophie gets up and offers to make breakfast, asking if Ethan wants bacon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film name-drops &lt;em&gt;The Twilight Zone&lt;/em&gt; but the first two acts are more reminiscent of David Lynch&amp;#39;s work.  Like Lynch&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Lost Highway (1997)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mulholland Dr. (1999)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The One I Love&lt;/em&gt; explores the subject of identity through a strange, inexplicable event. But the difference is that in Lynch&amp;#39;s films, the character&amp;#39;s motivations are never explicitly verbalized. If you define them, the rest of the story must serve them. When it doesn’t, you have plot holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And boy does &lt;em&gt;The One I Love&lt;/em&gt; have a lot of them. The whole film doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense, really. What was the point of imprisoning couples there? Why transform the previous couples into doppelgängers of the next ones? Why can they only leave after the other two have broken up? Why did their therapist send them in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all this, &lt;em&gt;The One I Love&lt;/em&gt; impressed me. It&amp;#39;s a brilliant concept that&amp;#39;s handled with the perfect tone. That it goes off the rails at the end doesn&amp;#39;t detract from the great performances and it&amp;#39;s biting insight into relationships. The plot holes don’t ruin the movie, they just handicap it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, just imagine if it didn&amp;#39;t try to explain the doppelgängers. Imagine if the scene where Ethan hears the other couple&amp;#39;s voices turning into his and Sophie&amp;#39;s was left out. Imagine if when Ethan confronted doppelgänger Sophie about not being real, she just sat and stared at him with that slightly unnatural smile. Then cut to the scene of Ethan and Sophie back home in bed laughing and Sophie getting up to make breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose this ending would leave some portion of the audience wanting. Lynch’s films are famous for that. They’re like lego sets. They provide the audience with the building blocks of a story, but leave it to the viewer to create their own interpretation and meaning. Unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;The One I Love&lt;/em&gt; is less like a set of legos and more like a puzzle. One that&amp;#39;s missing a few pieces.

It&amp;#39;s 1941. Robert Mitchum plays Mike Morrison, an American Correspondent who has just arrived in Greece. The Nazis are preparing to take the country and Mike plans to be on the next plane out. A member of the Greek resistance presents Mike with a list of Nazi collaborators. He urges Mike to take the list to British Intelligence. Mike declines, saying he doesn’t want to get involved. Later, while out with a friend, Mike discovers the list in his jacket.  Mike attempts to unload the list to another Greek agent, but Gestapo agents are already on Mike&amp;#39;s tail. They force him to flee through the darkened back streets of Athens. Mike escapes by hitching a ride on a British convoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. But then the film goes off the rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script jumps ahead. We learn that the Germans bombed the British Convoy and that Mike survived thanks to some fishermen who took him to a remote village. &lt;em&gt;Then&lt;/em&gt; the film jumps back and we see the convoy get bombed. Then we&amp;#39;re back with Mike in a small Greek village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These village scenes are dull and uninspiring. Stilted melodrama replaces suspense. A young, hotheaded female villager named Eleftheria nurses Mike back to health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Mike is healthy, the film devolves into a clumsy wartime adventure. The villagers ask Mike to lead them on a raid of a Nazi supply depot. Because, who better to lead a guerrilla raid in the Greek countryside than an American journalist? While they&amp;#39;re planning the raid, a British soldier shows up, says he&amp;#39;d like to help, learns all the details about the raid, then leaves. No one is concerned. Of course, the raid goes bad. The Nazi&amp;#39;s slaughter all the men save Mike and another, who manage to get away. When they can&amp;#39;t understand what happened, we almost laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit, Mike and Eleftheria travel to a convent where Mike&amp;#39;s given passage back to Athens. Once there, things get a little better, as the film shifts again, this time to a heist picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa, a widowed British spy, is Mike&amp;#39;s contact in Athens. The Gestapo gets wind of this and kidnaps Lisa&amp;#39;s children. She&amp;#39;s to turn over Mike if she wants to see her kids again. She sets Mike up, but changes her mind at the last minute. To rescue her children, she makes a deal with a local underworld figure named Chesney, played by Sebastian Cabot. Chesney double crosses the local Nazi agents while Lisa distracts the chief officer. It&amp;#39;s a satisfactory ending, but one in which Mike is superfluous. By this point the list is all but forgotten, having been supplanted by Lisa&amp;#39;s children as the motivating factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot of good here. The film looks great, especially when it&amp;#39;s in Athens. The location photography, and rich use of shadows give it a terrific sense of atmosphere. The cast is solid too. Mitchum is great as a reluctant hero. Stanley Baker is even better as the Gestapo Agent charged with capturing Mitchum. Cap it off with Sebastian Cabot channeling Sidney Greenstreet in the best way possible and this should have been a good movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in the end, &lt;em&gt;The Angry Hills&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#39;t really a movie at all.  It starts as a Hitchcockian spy thriller. But before it can get going, it drops that premise and sets up an action picture. And before &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; can pay off, it tries out a heist picture. Had it followed through on any of these premises, it would likely have turned out better&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Instead we’re given the beginning of one movie, the middle of another, and the end of yet another. Quite a disappointment given the talent involved.&lt;/p&gt;

David is a pioneer farmer living with his young son Davey in the Ohio wilderness. David&amp;#39;s wife Susan died the previous year, sinking him into depression. It&amp;#39;s only after finding Davey using a page from one of his school books as a sail for a toy boat, that David resolves to find a new wife. Not for love, but because he knew how important it was to Susan that Davey not grow up &amp;quot;woodsy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David travels to the nearby stockade and consults the Parson. The Parson suggests David buy the contract of a bond woman named Rachael. David likes the idea of a servant. A woman but not a wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Parson says, &amp;quot;Decent church folk don&amp;#39;t live together, man and woman, under the same roof without marriage.&amp;quot; So David marries Rachael and takes her back to his farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though he is distant, David is not cruel to her. She sleeps in the bed, David sleeps in another room on the floor. Rachael is timid, but works to endear herself. David takes no notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Davey, however, is downright cruel. When she tells him she was brought there to give him his schooling and sort of mother him, Davey spits back, &amp;quot;The devil it was! You&amp;#39;re a bond slave is all!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things change when Jim, a family friend played by Robert Mitchum, arrives. Jim&amp;#39;s a hunter and tracker. He was a one time suitor of Susan, and both he and David were surprised she chose David over him. Jim, it seems, has decided to settle down, and takes an instant interest in Rachel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim is attentive and charming. David gets jealous. Both men begin to vie for Rachel’s attention, culminating in a fist-fight that leads to Rachel leaving them both. They go after her. There&amp;#39;s an obligatory Indian attack, then it&amp;#39;s over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three leads are solid. Young and Holden are convincing, and Mitchum is great as a laconic woodsman. But this is not a good movie. It takes us for simpletons incapable of picking up any subtlety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider when, after arriving in the cabin, Rachael is clearing the table. David and Davey are talking. Davey says he won&amp;#39;t be getting any music lessons. We see Rachael pause. This should have been it. Instead, the film cuts to a drawn-out close-up of Rachael. We see her look off screen, open her mouth to say something, then close it and look down at Davey. Davey looks back, daring her to talk. She doesn&amp;#39;t and walks away. It&amp;#39;s a ten second scene that should have played out in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script is clumsy too. Consider the scene where David and Davey are out working. They hear a turkey call. Davey whines abut wanting to go take a shot at the bird. David grabs Davey and dives to the ground. The turkey call is the signal of the Shawnee Indians, he says. Of course, it&amp;#39;s just Jim, but when he steps out of the woods to greet David he tells them there&amp;#39;s signs of Shawnee up to the north. We haven&amp;#39;t heard a thing about Indians up to this point, but now the script mentions Shawnee four times in the span of two minutes. There isn&amp;#39;t a mention of them again until they attack in the finale. This scene, like the Indian attack itself, feels tacked-on and forced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s how most of this film works. Characters don&amp;#39;t act organically, they act &lt;em&gt;conveniently&lt;/em&gt;. Rachael is a reserved mouse until Jim and David get into a fight, then she announces she&amp;#39;s leaving. Rachael has to leave so that David can win her back. Davey spends most of the film spitting venom at Rachael, but after she makes him a meal one night, he&amp;#39;s happy to have her as his mother. Davey has to like her to allow David to fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And speaking of Davey, he&amp;#39;s an awful character. He&amp;#39;s whiny and obstinate. We&amp;#39;re given no reason to like him. Yes, he misses his mother. But the way he&amp;#39;s presented, one suspects he was annoying long before Susan departed this earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a kernel of a good story here, and the three leads are more than capable of pulling it off. But the hackneyed melodramatic fable they&amp;#39;re given to work with is frustrating at best, and annoying at worst. The adult themes of intimacy and emotional neglect belie a trite narrative that&amp;#39;s presented in a condescending manner. Given the talent involved, we deserve better.

If you&amp;#39;re on the fence about seeing it, do so. Don&amp;#39;t read any further, as we&amp;#39;re going to talk about plot and this movie works best the less you know going in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still here? Okay, here we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Locke&lt;/em&gt; opens with a wide shot of a construction site. It&amp;#39;s dark. Spotlights illuminate a massive foundation hole. Early the next morning, they will pour the concrete. It will be the largest commercial pour in Europe. Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) is the construction manager in charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan gets into his car. He pulls away from the curb and makes a call. He gets a woman&amp;#39;s voicemail. He tells her he&amp;#39;s gotten her message and that he&amp;#39;s on his way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the film unfolds we learn that Ivan is traveling to London from Birmingham. We also learn the circumstances surrounding the trip. Last year he had a one night stand while away on a job. The first and only time he&amp;#39;s strayed in fifteen years of marriage. But the woman, Bethan, became pregnant. Now, the baby has come early and she&amp;#39;s gone into labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the film happens in near real-time, as Ivan juggles a series of calls. We learn more about him. He is both diligent and pragmatic. The kind of man who makes checklists but is able to adapt to unforeseen circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it is with a deliberate logic that he approaches his current situation. He has fathered a child. Now he must do right by it. A deep-rooted psychological need drives him. Ivan&amp;#39;s father abandoned him. Ivan refuses to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film doles out this information in small bits as it unfolds. Each nugget raises the emotional stakes and increases the story’s tension. In time, Ivan loses his job, his family and his home. He accepts these events with a calm detachment. These are the consequences of his actions. He compartmentalizes them. He holds to his logic. He must be there for his child. Early on, when Bethan asks if he loves her, Ivan replies &amp;quot;How can I? I don&amp;#39;t know you.&amp;quot; His tone is not cruel. It is the voice of a man trying to convince her of a truth he needs to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching Ivan’s world unravel is a compelling journey. Tom Hardy holds our attention from the very first scene. We want to learn more about his character. Through his eyes and inflection, Hardy conveys a character struggling to contain a sea of emotions. Setting the entire film in Ivan’s car doesn’t feel like a stunt, it feels natural. It adds to the claustrophobic sense of desperation that the film cultivates. By the end, we’re hanging on every word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But about that end. Just as abruptly as it began, the film is over. Ivan&amp;#39;s world has changed and he heads off to what will be, for him, a new life. I didn&amp;#39;t like this ending, but I&amp;#39;m not sure how I would change it. It felt anti-climatic. Not enough to ruin the film, but enough that it left me wanting. But perhaps that&amp;#39;s the point. Just like Ivan, we’re left with an odd sense of detachment.

As is, it’s not a bad film, but it is something of a let-down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story follows an oil heiress named Korby Lane, played by Jean Simmons. Korby travels to the small town of Progress in rural Arkansas. Once there, she begins anonymously doling out large sums of money to the townsfolk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also takes an interest in Doc Sellers, played by Robert Mitchum. Doc susses out Korby&amp;#39;s motivations, and tries to dissuade her. But Korby is stubborn. Her generosity backfires. Flush with cash, the town vet pulls up stakes, leaving the local farmers in a lurch. So does the owner of the boarding house where Korby&amp;#39;s been staying. The town drunk, played by the always charming Arthur Hunnicutt, almost dies of alcohol poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the town descends into chaos, Korby realizes the error of her ways. She comes clean as the town&amp;#39;s beneficiary and says there&amp;#39;ll be no more money. Korby and Doc get together and we&amp;#39;re led to believe the town is more-or-less back to normal. Of course, we know that can&amp;#39;t be true, but this is part of how the film lets us down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a film built on a solid premise with a good cast. But the script has no edge. It plays like a bucolic romantic comedy. Nothing serious happens until the end, when masses of people show up at the general store. They&amp;#39;re all from out of town, hoping to register a local address to get a piece of the pie. The crowd swells. Tempers run short. Someone has a gun. Things start to turn ugly, but Doc arrives in time to settle things down with a hearty speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if he didn&amp;#39;t? What if the film started as a comedy but then subverted the genre to show the underside of small town life? A biting satire that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; explored the effects of sudden wealth on rural America. It might be wrong to criticize the film based on what &lt;em&gt;wasn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; made, but storytelling is about making decisions. And a decision &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do something is still a decision.&lt;/p&gt;

Too young to buy a ticket. Not that I wanted to. By that point, slasher films were passé.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, I remember this movie’s release. Word spread fast. Despite the title, Jason didn’t reach New York until the final twenty minutes. They should have called it &lt;em&gt;Jason Takes a Cruise&lt;/em&gt;, the joke went, as most of the film took place aboard a boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many fans, this perceived deception was reason enough to skip the film. They didn’t miss much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie opens with a teen couple fooling around on Crystal Lake. After an obligatory resurrection sequence, Jason makes short work of the teens and reclaims his trademark hockey mask&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to the following morning. The local high school’s graduating class sets sail for New York City aboard the Lazarus, an old ocean liner. As they depart, Jason sneaks aboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Jason disappears passengers, we’re presented with a series of subplots involving the students. Our protagonist, Rennie, has visions of a child drowning. The captain’s son, Sean, disappoints his father by fumbling the nautical equivalent of backing the car out of the garage. The prom queen tries to blackmail her biology teacher by seducing him on video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After thinning the supporting cast, Jason kills the captain. Sean discovers his father’s body and alerts the others. In a refreshing twist, the kids arm themselves and prepare to go on the offensive. But a contrived series of events sinks the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sean, Rennie, and a few others escape and row to New York City. Jason is, of course, right behind them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finale sees Rennie and Sean fleeing Jason through a sewer tunnel due to be flushed with toxic waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a good movie, but it’s better than its predecessor, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/friday-the-13th-part-vii-the-new-blood-1988/&quot;&gt;Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Although the script saddles its protagonist with an overwrought subplot, it finds time to pepper the supporting cast with personality and even offers some chuckles. Granted, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/friday-the-13th-the-final-chapter-1984/&quot;&gt;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; had a more memorable cast, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/jason-lives-friday-the-13th-part-vi-1986/&quot;&gt;Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; had wittier humor, but I can appreciate the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, Jason spends more time prowling the Lazarus’s corridors than Manhattan’s streets, but so what? After seven films set at Camp Crystal Lake (or a reasonable facsimile), isn’t any scenery change welcome?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film’s biggest disappointment isn’t Jason’s meandering journey to New York, it’s that, once he’s there, he gets tunnel vision. He walks through swaths of pedestrians and ignores them. Aside from some street punks, he’s only interested in the Lazarus survivors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason should be a one-man apocalypse, killing anyone within reach. Why else transplant him to the country’s most populous city?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan&lt;/em&gt; is more disappointing than awful. Aside from a change of scenery, it offers little we haven’t seen done better before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came to &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood&lt;/em&gt; with an open mind. Sure, I’d heard rumblings it was bad, but the masses can be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story opens with seven-year-old Tina standing outside a house on Crystal Lake. Inside, we hear her parents fighting. Mom’s yelling at Dad, saying he promised he wouldn’t drink so much. Dad’s smacking Mom and telling her to shut up. It aims for drama but plays as caricature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tina runs down to the lake, walks down a short pier, and gets into a small fishing boat. She motors out to the middle of the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad comes running out of the house&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. He yells for her to come back. Mom comes out and joins in the yelling. Dad advances down the pier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tina gives Dad the stink-eye of death and the pier starts shaking. Not a rumble, but a full-on cartoonish wobble. With the pylons jutting several feet into the air, it resembles a carnival ride gone haywire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pier crumbles into the lake, taking Dad with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We flash-forward to a seventeen-year-old&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Tina returning to Crystal Lake along with her mother. Her smarmy psychiatrist, Dr. Crews, insists Tina confront her father’s death by revisiting the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tina and her mother arrive at the lake house. They find Dr. Crews waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next door is an obligatory house full of teens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few needless scenes later, Tina’s telekinesis reanimates Jason&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, who sets to work massacring the teens&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
Meanwhile, Tina’s mom uncovers Dr. Crews’ true intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of over-emoting and dues ex machina that culminates in Tina hurling flower pots at Jason with her mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so the masses were right. Sitting through this was a chore. Like the song says: &lt;em&gt;Sometimes, bad is bad&lt;/em&gt;. Lesson learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should have been better. The script borrows its setup from the franchise’s best entry, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/friday-the-13th-the-final-chapter-1984/&quot;&gt;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. And Kane Hodder brings a hulking physicality to his performance as Jason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the film tacks on a mill stone subplot involving telekinetic Tina, her mother, and Dr. Crews that sinks the movie. More than once, I ached to fast-forward through these scenes. They aren’t just bad. They’re screaming baby on an airplane bad. Painful for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t fault the performers; the script does them no favors. Consider Tina. She’s an ineffectual protagonist who spends most of the film in histrionics. The worst kind of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_girl&quot;&gt;final girl&lt;/a&gt;. When the other teens take an instant dislike to her, we’re on their side. And speaking of those teens, they’re just fodder. None of them register as individuals and they have no chemistry together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, the film takes itself far too seriously. The black humor of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/jason-lives-friday-the-13th-part-vi-1986/&quot;&gt;Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is gone. So is the manic campiness of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/friday-the-13th-a-new-beginning-1985/&quot;&gt;Friday the 13th: A New Beginning (1985)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, we suffer through scenes alternating between idle boredom and overwrought melodrama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jason offs a character, it’s a relief. Not because it breaks some nonexistent tension, but because we’re one step closer to the film’s end. In &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood&lt;/em&gt;, it’s the audience, not Jason’s quarry, that suffers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought upon seeing Dad: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Smalley&quot;&gt;Stewart Smalley&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting this entry in the then-future of 2001. I wonder how many fans realized this back in 1988.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason ended the prior film chained to the bottom of Crystal Lake. The script doesn’t try to explain how Tina’s telekinesis revives him. In his &lt;a href=&quot;http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com/2009/01/friday-13th-part-vii-new-blood.html&quot;&gt;review on Horror Movie A Day&lt;/a&gt;, Brian Collins speculates the telekinesis aspect was a response to the higher grossing A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie should end here. Tina resurrects Jason and passes out. Jason dismembers her unconscious body. But no. Jason marches past her &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; both houses. He goes a few miles up a dark road to off a pair of teens before circling back to continue his rampage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref4&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Not &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI&lt;/em&gt;. After the disappointing grosses of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/friday-the-13th-a-new-beginning-1985/&quot;&gt;Friday the 13th: A New Beginning (1985)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Paramount wasn’t taking any chances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry more-or-less ignores the prior film’s events. It opens with Tommy Jarvis determined to rid himself of the specter of Jason. En route to Crystal Lake, he plans to dig up Jason’s corpse and incinerate it. He’s even brought a buddy along for help&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tommy and his friend dig up the corpse all right, but a lightening strike reanimates the maggot-filled carcass. Undead Jason makes short work of Tommy’s pal but Tommy escapes to warn the local sheriff. Of course, the sheriff doesn’t believe Tommy and runs him out of town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Jason resumes his murderous ways. He offs some corporate paintballers and a few teen camp counselors before Tommy gets back to town. Thinking Tommy committed the murders, the sheriff puts Tommy behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to worry though, the sheriff’s plucky teen daughter soon frees Tommy from his cell. Then, using a plan Tommy gleaned from reading a book on the occult, the two head to Camp Crystal Lake to confront Jason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry cements Jason’s transition from deranged madman to supernatural monster. Jason now has super human strength. Bullets can’t kill him. Early on, Tommy looks to incinerate Jason, but the skies open and the resulting rain prevents Tommy from striking a match. It’s a nice nod that casts Jason as something of a force of nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This installment also sports a nice streak of self-referential black comedy. As Jason stalks a group of children, one boy asks another in a deadpan tone: “So, what did you want to be when you grew up?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, when Jason’s on-screen this entry’s a lot of fun. Unfortunately, the plot revolves around Tommy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better script would have killed him off during the opening sequence. Instead, we suffer through a tired “boy who cried wolf” plot that never pays off, while cringing at the stilted melodrama with the sheriff’s daughter. A stronger performer could have risen above the material. But Thom Mathews’ wooden performance as Tommy kept reminding me of Michael Dudikoff in &lt;em&gt;American Ninja (1985)&lt;/em&gt;. Minus the ninja bad-assery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus on Tommy handicaps the supporting cast. Most of Jason’s victims are forgettable. The female camp counselors, in particular, feel like interchangeable fodder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t an awful movie, but the forced melodrama and bland supporting cast drag things down. Whenever Jason’s off-screen, &lt;em&gt;Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI&lt;/em&gt; is a snooze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They ditched Jason and tried to reboot the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th: The New Beginning&lt;/em&gt; follows Tommy, the boy we last saw hacking Jason apart with a machete. He’s seventeen now, having spent the previous six years in a state mental institution. This rare bit of plausibility sets the film in 1990, give or take a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being the nominal lead, Tommy&amp;#39;s superficial to the plot and says under two-dozen words throughout the film. His scenes consist of him either looking confused or erupting in sudden violent outbursts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting is, of course, a remote camp. This time, a halfway house for troubled teens meant to ease their re-entry into society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot kicks into gear after one teen murders another with an axe then disappears into the surrounding woods. Following that, an unseen assailant begins murdering teens, staff, and pretty-much everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harkening back to the original &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th (1980)&lt;/em&gt;, this entry withholds the killer’s identity until the finale. We’re offered several red-herrings, making this film more mystery-thriller than monster movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the execution is sloppy. The script introduces characters then kills them in the same scene. Several performances veer well into camp. One character even dies trapped in a graffiti-covered outhouse after eating some spicy enchiladas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse still, the killer’s eventual reveal elicits groans instead of gasps. The script offers an explanation via some awkward exposition, but it’s unsatisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But time has been kind. Knowing the franchise rights itself, fans can laugh at the nonsense plot, Tommy’s non-dialog, and the hammy performances. I cannot recommend &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th: A New Beginning&lt;/em&gt;, yet I can&amp;#39;t wholly condemn it either. Like any comically bad movie, it&amp;#39;s best viewed with a crowd that knows what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s no surprise Paramount brought Jason back for the sequel, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/jason-lives-friday-the-13th-part-vi-1986/&quot;&gt;Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first great scene comes early. Jonathan Harker has arrived at Castle Dracula posing as a librarian. While prowling the castle’s corridors at night, he finds a young woman. She sports full lips, brilliant blue eyes and ample cleavage. She is terrified. She claims she’s being held prisoner and begs Harker to help her escape. Harker feigns ignorance. She persists. His resolve weakens. He agrees to help her. Grateful, she bursts into tears and buries her head in his shoulder. The music shifts. Her eyes fix on Harker’s neck. Her head tilts back as her eyes close. Her glistening lips draw back to reveal fangs. She bites Harker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as she does, Dracula (Christopher Lee) explodes into the room with a piercing shriek. Lee is feral and demonic. The camera zooms in. Lee’s bloodshot eyes pin us to our seats. His gore-smeared mouth twists into a snarl revealing blood-covered fangs. The shot lasts all of a few seconds, but it still packs a punch. This is Dracula in all his visceral glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second great scene happens at about the three-quarters mark. It’s night and Arthur Holmwood (Michael Gough) has gone to the crypt of his recently deceased sister Lucy to assure himself that she is not a vampire. To Arthur’s horror, he finds Lucy seemingly alive, returning to her tomb, leading a young girl. Lucy sees him. Her eyes light up with more than just brotherly love. “Come, let me kiss you,” she says to Arthur. She advances, baring her fangs. Arthur stands helpless, transfixed by her gaze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before she can consummate the act, Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) bursts onto the scene, thrusting a crucifix into Lucy’s face. She backs away in agony. Van Helsing, jaw set, eyes full of cold detachment, advances. Lucy’s cornered. Van Helsing presses the crucifix to her forehead. The flesh smolders and burns, leaving the imprint of the cross. Van Helsing stares down, unmoved. Lucy shrieks and flees into her tomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a crackerjack scene that works just as well today as it did half a century ago. The practical effects still look great and Cushing’s performance in the scene is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third great scene is the finale. Arthur and Van Helsing have chased Dracula back to his castle. Dawn is fast approaching. Van Helsing catches the Count before he can disappear down a secret passage. The two grapple. Dracula looks to have the upper hand. In a flash of inspiration, Van Helsing vaults atop a long table, runs the length, and launches himself toward the wall. He hits the wall high and pulls down the tapestry curtains, letting in the morning sun. Dracula tries to flee, but Van Helsing fashions a make-shift crucifix out of candle holders to pin him in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These swashbuckling acrobatics cement Van Helsing as the heroic foil to the villainous Dracula. Cushing’s Van Helsing isn’t just a wise man with a strong will, he’s a man of action. The iconic monster hunter out to rid the world of supernatural evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I vacillate between this film and &lt;em&gt;Dracula (1931)&lt;/em&gt; for my favorite interpretation of the Count. I prefer Lee’s grittier performance, but dislike the overt physicality. His Dracula runs, grapples, and digs holes&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It makes for more action on screen, but also lends the character a vulnerability that softens his edge. Also, Lee doesn’t have any dialog apart from his introductory scene, which is a shame. A battle of wills between Cushing and Lee would have been dynamite&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Imagine Lee, with his ominous baritone, delivering the classic line, “For one who has not lived even a single lifetime, you’re a wise man, Van Helsing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these are minor quibbles. Buoyed by iconic performances from Cushing and Lee, &lt;em&gt;Horror of Dracula&lt;/em&gt; is a great film. It rolls along at a terrific pace. By paring down the supporting cast and playing up the sex and gore, it makes the familiar plot feel fresh and new. It turns a gothic horror story into a thrilling adventure. Howard Hawks’ definition of a good movie may be a bit simplistic, but &lt;em&gt;Horror of Dracula&lt;/em&gt; is proof that simple can work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hole-digging scene always throws me. Why wouldn’t he put her in the crypt? And how does he happen to have a shovel handy?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee and Cushing wouldn’t meet again as Dracula and Van Helsing until the disappointing &lt;em&gt;Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972)&lt;/em&gt;. Cushing starred in the immediate sequel &lt;em&gt;The Brides of Dracula (1960)&lt;/em&gt; which lacked Lee. Lee returned in the third installment &lt;em&gt;Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966)&lt;/em&gt; which lacked Cushing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I knew the instant it happened. I may have uttered a small groan. But I’m getting ahead of myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s three or four generations into the future. Earth is drying up. Giant dust storms ravage the planet. Blight has eradicated all the world’s crops, save corn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew McConaughey plays Cooper, a former test pilot/engineer who, like just about everyone else, must farm to survive. He hates it, but does it to support his two young children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of gravitational anomalies lead him to the remnants of NASA. NASA has a plan to save humanity. They’ve discovered a wormhole near Saturn leading to potentially hospitable worlds. They’ve got a ship and crew ready. They just need a pilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooper agrees, even though the journey’s length means he’ll miss years of his children’s lives. If he makes it back at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flight goes smoothly and the crew pass through the wormhole in a sequence that begs favorable comparisons with &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)&lt;/em&gt;. On the other side they assess their situation. They count three potential worlds, but the closest and most promising orbits the outskirts of a black hole. This creates a warping effect with time. An hour spent on the planet equates to seven years back on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They agree to be quick. Cooper pilots a shuttle craft to the planet’s surface. Of course, there are complications. They return just over three hours later, and learn twenty-three years have passed on Earth. Cooper checks his video mail. He sees his son graduate high school, meet a girl, and get married. He sees the birth and death of his grandson. Finally, he sees his son, now a man older than himself, say goodbye, resigned that Cooper is never coming back. Cooper has missed it all. It flattens him and us. Never has a movie conveyed the isolation of space travel like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Cooper gets a message from his daughter. They had a rough goodbye. She felt Cooper was abandoning her. Now, she’s a full grown woman, the same age as him. But she hasn’t forgiven his leaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this brings us to the point I mentioned earlier. The point where &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt; loses its way. The film cuts to Cooper’s daughter as she finishes her message. Now we’re back on Earth. No longer alone. Now, we have parallel stories, Cooper in space and Cooper’s family on earth. What started as a meditation on mankind transcending Earth devolves into a predictable melodrama. The special effects are fantastic, and the set pieces are tense and well-executed, but the film lacks anything new to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to think &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt;’s reach exceeded its grasp. That it tried and failed. I don’t think it tried at all. Rather than explore new themes it settled for familiar dramatic scenarios. Granted, it executes those tropes with masterful precision, but it’s still a letdown. &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t transcend the science fiction genre, it abandons it.

What I knew of the &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th&lt;/em&gt; films came via third-hand bits of lore relayed in wide-eyed whispers on the playground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason was a hockey mask wearing monster who killed people in awful, horrific ways. I remember, at the video store, seeing the franchise’s iconic box covers. I felt certain those white stencils holding bloody knives or axes were gateways to pure, brutal terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it’s an odd sense of nostalgia that draws me to the series now. Of course, the films aren’t as scary as my young self believed. They’re not scary at all. But watching them takes me back to days of looking for prizes in breakfast cereals. Back when a monster like Jason represented the pinnacle of terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This installment picks up where &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th Part III (1982)&lt;/em&gt; ends&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Hanged after suffering a hatchet to the face, Jason is dead. The police cart his body off to the morgue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, he’s not dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason wakes up, dispatches some improbably young hospital staff members, then heads back to Crystal Lake to work through a house of oversexed teens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This script operates on a simple, but proven, formula: titillate then shock&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Show some nudity, then have Jason dispatch someone in a gruesome, over-the-top, fashion. To that end, it delivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it also goes a step further by fleshing out its cast of teen victims. They spend much of the film unaware of Jason or any suspicious goings-on. They’re in their own movie, complete with their own sub-plots. Granted, those sub-plots amount to little more than a bad teen sex comedy, but they hold our interest when Jason’s off-screen&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when Jason’s on-screen, he’s a juggernaut. An unstoppable, inhuman force of evil. A demon with a machete&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Consider how Jason never runs. Running implies chasing. Chasing suggest the possibility of escape. In this film, Jason isn’t an assailant, he’s an inevitability&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn5&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter&lt;/em&gt; is pure, well-executed, exploitation. An amalgam of gratuitous nudity and creative violence. A visceral thrill-ride. It’s not a great movie, but it’s everything my younger self could have hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Films two, three, and four happen back-to-back over four days. This entry starts on Sunday the 15th, and ends on Tuesday the 17th. Yet one character is out to avenge his dead sister, who Jason killed in the second film. Said character has been compiling newspaper clippings on Jason since her death. Except, by the film’s timeline, his sister died less than 48 hours ago. Was he scrapbooking during the funeral?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slasher films aren’t alone in this. One of the best scares in &lt;em&gt;Alien (1979)&lt;/em&gt; comes after the camera lingers on some pin-ups of nude women.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also helps that Crispin Glover’s performance foreshadows his turn in &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future (1985)&lt;/em&gt;. His dancing scene almost makes the movie.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a supernatural inevitability, in addition to asphyxiation, Jason would seem immune to the laws of physics. Consider his going from outside the second-floor window to inside the first-floor kitchen in a matter of seconds without making a sound.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref5&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the film does an admirable job bringing new viewers up to speed. Our heroine, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) has just destroyed the titular Hunger Games, dealing a symbolic blow to the Evil Capitol. Rebel forces have rescued Katniss, but they failed to rescue her true love Peeta, who’s now in the Evil Capitol’s clutches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In offering a plot summary for this installment however, I am at a loss. Watching it felt like watching the deleted scenes from another film. A better one, where things actually happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we see Katniss fret about Peeta, walk through some rubble-strewn towns, and fret about Peeta some more. The threadbare plot culminates in a tepid rescue mission that leaves the characters more-or-less where they started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In writing, one should omit needless words &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In film, one should omit needless scenes. By this rule, &lt;em&gt;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1&lt;/em&gt; should be twenty minutes long instead of two hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With few exceptions, every scene should further the plot or enhance characterization. Consider the scenes depicting Katniss’s struggles in filming staged propaganda messages. These scenes setup later scenes where she delivers a stirring call-to-arms once she’s on the ground amidst the dead and wounded. As a whole, they exist to show Katniss’s honesty and empathy. But these are traits we already know she possesses. Cutting these scenes wouldn’t affect the story or diminish the depth of Katniss’s character. They’re redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a misguided focus on the rebel’s exploitation of Katniss. There are scenes of rebel leaders strategizing. One of the chief aids is, essentially, a publicist. There’s an interesting angle here, but the film paints its factions in such broad strokes it loses any shot at credible political commentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A movie doesn’t need explosive action or labyrinthine plot to succeed, but it does need a purpose. This film has none, save to gouge fans for the cost of an extra ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Lawrence is a talented actress capable of commanding our attention on screen, but one wouldn’t know it from watching her here. Between the ill-fitting jumpsuit and pale makeup, she looks every bit as listless as the script. Her supporting cast includes Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore. Both avoid rolling their eyes at the dialog, a feat I consider award-worthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, &lt;em&gt;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1&lt;/em&gt; is a non-movie. Fans of the series should skip straight to the real finale in &lt;em&gt;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s night. Cross-fade from natives pounding jungle drums to a woman gazing out her bedroom window. The camera pulls back and up, away from her window and over acres of dark jungle to settle behind a man standing on his porch, gazing at the woman’s bungalow in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, the shot’s tracking over an obvious paper-mâché model, but kudos to director Alfred Green for trying. This is a movie whose reach exceeds its grasp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man in the shot is Hugh, played by William Powell. The woman is Phillipa, played by Doris Kenyon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film opens with them en route to Khota, a small tropical island in the Pacific. Hugh has returned alone after supposedly running off with another man’s wife. Phillipa has come to marry the local doctor, a man she hardly knows. Hugh pursues Phillipa, but she rebukes his advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After they arrive in Khota, Phillipa gets married. The marriage goes south fast. She wants him to sweep her off her feet, he wants her to find his socks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugh and Phillipa flirt. Her resolve weakens. Things come to a head when Phillipa, believing her husband to be out of town, accepts Hugh’s invitation to dine at his bungalow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film tries for passionate drama but falls short. Too many characters deliver their lines while staring off at nothing in particular. At least the pre-code script delivers a satisfying, and plausible, ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes &lt;em&gt;The Road to Singapore&lt;/em&gt; worth watching is William Powell’s performance. Despite the tropical locale, Powell exudes the urbane wit and charm that would become his trademark. He ambles through the film, impervious to the mediocre melodrama. Powell doesn’t so much carry the movie as rise above it.&lt;/p&gt;

How else to review it? Plot is all it offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s World War I and the British are hurting. Every plan they make leaks to the Germans. The British suspect the famed German spy Strendler has infiltrated their organization, but no one can identify him. Desperate to weed out Strendler, the British plan to recall their best agent from undercover duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plan also leaks to the Germans. They kill the British agent and shoot down his extraction plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pilot, Frank Bennett, survives. We see him recovering in a hospital. A nurse, Helene von Lorbeer, played by Margaret Lindsay, tends to him. There’s an attraction between the two, but von Lorbeer says she has to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Von Lorbeer turns out to be a German spy. She’s recalled to headquarters, given a commendation and a new assignment. Posing as a refugee, she’s to infiltrate the house of British cabinet minister Arthur Bennett. Arthur is, of course, Frank’s father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Von Lorbeer quickly ingratiates herself with the Bennett family. Her German contact is the family butler Valdar, played by Boris Karloff. Unbeknownst to von Lorbeer, Valdar is a double-agent, reporting to the head of British Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some sloppy code-passing by von Lorbeer arouses the suspicions of British Intelligence. They set a trap involving a would-be German agent, but Von Lorbeer sees through it, maintaining her cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The return of Frank Bennett prompts von Lorbeer to reveal that she’s actually a British agent. Valdar overhears this and forces von Lorbeer into the cellar at gunpoint. Von Lorbeer claims she invented the British agent story to allay Frank’s suspicions. Valdar doesn’t believe her, but relents after seeing her German commendation. He admits that he is Strendler. Further, the British cabinet are meeting upstairs and he’s planted a bomb to level the house under the guise of a Zeppelin bombing. He’s even stolen plans for the next British offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the authorities had suspected Valdar and kept him under surveillance. They rush into the cellar and disarm the bomb but Valdar flees with the plans. He’s shot during his escape but makes it to a German safe house. Just as German agents prepare to transmit the British plans, a Zeppelin bomb levels the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of plot. The labyrinthine twists of agents, double agents, and triple agents, leave little room for characterization. But maybe that’s by design. Characterization requires a degree of plausibility, and &lt;em&gt;British Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; has none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Valdar’s big reveal that he is Strendler. If Valdar was a British agent, he would have told the British about von Lorbeer, making the ruse involving the fake German agent unnecessary. But, if Valdar didn’t tell the British about von Lorbeer, how did they know her handler’s code phrases? Surely, they wouldn’t be reused between agents. And just how did Valdar acquire so much guarded information? His espionage consists of little-more than standing outside thin doors or open windows. As a butler, he wouldn’t be privy to anything discussed at a secure location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse still, even at only an hour and six minutes, &lt;em&gt;British Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; is too long. The lengthy opening sequence only serves to introduce Frank Bennett, who disappears for much of the film, only to surface a few minutes before the end. Why not start with von Lorbeer undercover? She’d be a sympathetic character until her reveal as a German spy, which would have been a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;British Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; may be overlong and beset with plot holes, but at least it’s got Karloff. His performance in what amounts to a triple role is the film’s lone bright spot. And it’s nice seeing him work outside the horror genre, even if the resulting picture is underwhelming.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Bill is a slick defense lawyer famous for using any technicality or loophole to get his clients an acquittal, despite their obvious guilt. He’s so well-respected in the underworld that, when his car’s stolen, the crooks return it after getting a look at the registration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill’s seeing a showgirl, Irene, played by Kay Francis. Irene wants Bill to marry her, but Bill says he’s not the marrying kind. Irene’s also seeing another guy, Jack, behind Bill’s back. Jack’s a nice-enough guy, but he lacks Bill’s swagger. Jack wants to marry Irene, but Irene just strings him along, hoping Bill will change his mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early one morning, Irene’s driving Jack home. They’ve been out all night and Jack’s pie-eyed drunk. Jack gropes at her, causing her to hit and kill a stranded motorist. Recognizing what being discovered with him at the early hour would do to Irene’s reputation, Jack insists she flee the scene. Jack stays and takes the rap for the death alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irene persuades Bill to take Jack’s case. She doesn’t tell Bill she was there. Things look bad for Jack. As the evidence comes to light, Bill realizes Irene’s involvement. Soon, Bill must chose between Irene’s reputation and Jack’s liberty. Irene wants to take the stand to exonerate Jack, but Bill won’t let her. There’s another option, but it means crossing a line Bill vowed he would never cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As melodramas go, &lt;em&gt;For the Defense&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a bad one. Early on, when Bill’s riding high, his urbane charm, affinity for alcohol&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and underworld connections foreshadow Powell’s famous turn as Nick Charles in the &lt;em&gt;Thin Man&lt;/em&gt; series of films. Francis plays well opposite him and doesn’t overact her part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the film sees both of them delivering lines and, mid-sentence, turning to gaze at nothing in particular for dramatic effect. It’s an annoying affectation that mars an otherwise passable hour and five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liam Neeson stars as Matthew Scudder, a recovering alcoholic and ex-cop. Scudder quit the force after gunning down some street toughs robbing his neighborhood bar. His superiors begged him to stay, calling him a hero and giving him a commendation. Scudder quit anyway. He quit drinking too. Later, we learn his actions weren’t quite so heroic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scudder makes his living as an unlicensed private investigator. He goes to work for a drug trafficker who’s wife was kidnapped, raped, tortured, and killed. The trail leads Scudder to a pair of horrific sociopaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scudder works the case as the killers stalk their next target. A better film would focus on the creepy killers, but this script doubles down on cop movie tropes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scudder acquires a sidekick in the form of a plucky, street-smart homeless boy named TJ. TJ has sickle-cell anemia; a plot point designed to engender audience sympathy and facilitate an improbable third act. Will TJ break through Scudder’s tough exterior? I think you know the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film’s contempt for its audience’s intelligence is galling. Scudder verbalizes every clue, even when it makes no sense for him to do so. At one point, Scudder discovers some badly written romance fiction. He reads it aloud even though he’s alone and the camera is on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoon-feeding plot-points like this causes the film to drag. Consider the opening sequence. Scudder sits in a car with his partner, who&amp;#39;s bemoaning Scudder&amp;#39;s drinking, saying he worries he can&amp;#39;t count on Scudder to have his back. Scudder gets out of the car and walks into a bar. It&amp;#39;s morning. He grabs a paper and sits down. Without a word, the bartender brings Scudder a coffee and two shots of whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not open with Scudder entering the bar? The morning light and wordless exchange tell us everything. And the partner? We never see him again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia tells me the film combines several Lawrence Block novels. Maybe the script condensed too many subplots into a single movie, or maybe the books were just bad. Either way, it’s pretty damning that Liam Neeson’s would-be New York accent is the least of this film’s problems.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

How refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macon Blair stars as Dwight, a drifter living in a rusted car on the Delaware coast. When he learns his parents&amp;#39; murderer is receiving an early parole, he returns to his small Virginia hometown to exact revenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blue Ruin&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t settle for revenge movie tropes. Dwight isn&amp;#39;t confident and driven. He&amp;#39;s desperate and scared. He exacts his revenge in a clumsy and brutal bit of violence that leaves him bloody and shaken. His escape proves equally sloppy, leaving him to await the inevitable retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roger Ebert was fond of saying, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not what the movie is about, but how it is about it,&amp;quot; and that&amp;#39;s true of &lt;em&gt;Blue Ruin&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#39;s a simple story, but I loved its straightforward, character-driven, approach. We meet Dwight as he&amp;#39;s easing into a warm bath inside a cozy single family home. Just as he gets comfortable, the owners arrive and Dwight flees. It&amp;#39;s a terrific introduction that draws us into his story. As Dwight&amp;#39;s retribution spirals out of control, we grow concerned for him, investing us in the finale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blair is perfect in the role. He never tells us how Dwight is feeling, but his eyes speak volumes. As Dwight watches his parents&amp;#39; killer leave prison, Blair&amp;#39;s expression mirrors the bile and nausea churning in Dwight&amp;#39;s stomach. Later, after Dwight has taken his revenge, Blair&amp;#39;s darting gaze and vacant eyes communicate Dwight&amp;#39;s shock. It&amp;#39;s an award-worthy performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film has its flaws: a bit of on-the-nose dialog and a suspect backstory, but these are minor quibbles. &lt;em&gt;Blue Ruin&lt;/em&gt; is that rarest of thrillers, one that places its characters first.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karloff plays Nathaniel Billings, an eccentric but earnest old professor. Billings spends his days working in the basement laboratory of his crumbling New England tavern home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along comes Winnie, a young divorcee who wants to buy Billings&amp;#39; house and turn it into an inn. Billings agrees to sell, provided he can stay on and complete his experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Winnie doesn&amp;#39;t know Billings is trying to engineer an army of atomic supermen to aid the war effort. Or that his test subjects comprise the assorted traveling salesmen that chance upon his door. Or that his experiments have all been fatal failures, leaving him with a room full of well-preserved corpses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would expect this sort of thing to come to light during the walk-through, but the script gives Winnie the mental acuity of a toddler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorre plays Arthur Lorencz, a smarmy opportunist who&amp;#39;s the town doctor. He&amp;#39;s also the mayor, mortician, notary, and everything else. He even holds the mortgage on Billings&amp;#39; home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Lorencz, as town sheriff, discovers one of the corpses, he confronts Billings. With idyllic pride, Billings explains his experiments. Lorencz sees dollar signs. Never mind the dead body, Billings&amp;#39; experiments could net a fortune! Soon they&amp;#39;re partners bemoaning the lack of quality “test subjects”. It&amp;#39;s a terrific bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But rather than continue with this low-key, edgy material, the script degenerates into outright farce. The finale sees the cast held hostage by an escaped fascist seeking to blow up a nearby munitions depot. Because, of course, it makes perfect sense to open an inn next to a munitions depot. Karloff and Lorre do their best, but &lt;em&gt;The Boogie Man Will Get You&lt;/em&gt; wastes their potential.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He plays Frank Taylor, a senior machinist and family man who loses an expected promotion to a younger co-worker from an immigrant family. Feeling angry and cheated, Frank falls in with the titular Legion, a black-robed hate group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Legion run Frank’s co-worker out of town and Frank ascends to foreman. Things are great until Frank&amp;#39;s Legion-mandated recruiting sees him demoted in favor of his neighbor. Again, the Legion intervenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secrecy and violence wear on Frank. He drinks to excess. His family leaves him. He takes up with a local floozy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night, drunk and despondent, Frank confesses everything to his longtime friend Ed. After sobering up, Frank panics and informs the Legion. The Legion kidnap Ed, but things don&amp;#39;t go as planned, leaving Frank with blood on his hands and nowhere to turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in his career, most of Bogart’s roles were hard-nosed gangsters. Later, he would personify the tough loner. Here, Bogart plays a weak man with a wife and young child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than a one-dimensional racist, Bogart portrays Frank as a weak-willed man driven by a sense of entitlement. Bogart’s fearless performance doesn’t generate any sympathy for Frank, but it does engender pity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script’s biting look at the Legion&amp;#39;s recruiting scheme helps. We’re shown how radio demagogues cultivate resentment and fear, driving Legion membership. New members buy mandatory uniforms and revolvers, fattening the wallets of a small group of profiteers who, in turn, fund the demagogues. This exposé gives the film a docudrama feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I couldn’t swallow Frank&amp;#39;s abrupt transformation from honest family man to drunken womanizer. It feels disingenuous. Racism and hate don&amp;#39;t hit you like a freight train, they eat at you like a cancer. That&amp;#39;s what makes them so insidious. Making things so obvious diminishes Bogart’s performance and undermines the film’s still-relevant social context.&lt;/p&gt;

One great, one mediocre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It opens with an armored car rumbling down a London street. Cut to a man aboard a boat approaching the Tower Bridge. He raises his arm to check the time. Zoom in on his wristwatch. It’s just after dawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to another wristwatch. Pull back to reveal a man smoking a cigarette in a car. He glances at the rear-view mirror and gives a slight nod. Two linebacker-sized men get out and unload a swath of equipment, including a large coil of thick rope. The car pulls away and speeds across Tower Bridge, stopping on the opposite side. The driver and passenger exit the car, hurry across the road, and hide. Looking down, one of them checks his wristwatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to another wristwatch. Pull back to reveal the burly men who exited the car prior. They setup a roadblock to divert traffic, then rush onto the bridge to secure the heavy rope for the group’s escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to the armored car approaching. The driver, an inside man, stops just before the bridge. The hidden men, now masked, spring into action. Guns drawn, they force their way inside the armored car and maneuver it across the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to the Tower Bridge operator. Klaus Kinski sneaks up behind him, knocks him out, drags him back into the control booth, and raises the Tower Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut back to the armored car. With the roadblock diverting traffic on one end, and the raised bridge blocking traffic on the other, the thieves loot the armored car. Using the heavy rope, they zip the cash bags down to a boat waiting below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a terrific opening. Almost no dialog. Just crackerjack editing and great location photography. Granted, with no sign of a circus or top-billed Christopher Lee, one can imagine theater-goers in 1966 feeling confused. Did the projectionist queue the wrong movie? As if to assure them, the opening titles appear, backed by an oddly catchy theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the entire heist was a McGuffin. All the crooks except Kinski are killed. This was a British-German co-production and Kinski was big in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting shifts to the winter home of the Barberini circus. The pacing slows. Things get talky. Over twenty minutes in, Christopher Lee finally shows up. He plays Gregor, an enigmatic lion tamer who wears a black balaclava to mask his disfigurement. Leo Genn plays a police inspector poking around after the stolen money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, the movie devolves into an unremarkable whodunit. An unseen, knife-throwing assailant picks off potential suspects. There are lots of red herrings and at least one plot twist you’ll see coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a bad movie, but &lt;em&gt;Circus of Fear&lt;/em&gt; squanders the talent involved. Director John Moxey can build atmosphere (as the opening heist shows) but the convoluted plot gives him few opportunities. Christopher Lee spends much of his limited screen time wearing a ridiculous hood. And Klaus Kinski&amp;#39;s post-heist role sees him reduced to lurking about in the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s frustrating. We may learn the killer’s identity, but the real mystery lies in what the principals could have done with better material.&lt;/p&gt;

</content></entry><entry><title>The Bloody Judge (1970)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-bloody-judge-1970//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-bloody-judge-1970/</id><updated>2014-08-03</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-bloody-judge-1970/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NZCn_6ildwpckDcHyDrqDXGVRwBF6VMfT35u9GfZbGCaM6YhT_OwOwtv6EarXdKhrTzrhB7xqjcp=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extras on &lt;em&gt;The Bloody Judge&lt;/em&gt; DVD are more interesting than the feature film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story takes place in England during the final days of King James II. Christopher Lee plays George Jeffreys, an infamous judge who meted out death sentences to suppress the burgeoning rebellion. These sham trials became known as the Bloody Assizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aforementioned DVD extras, Lee describes Jeffreys as a Jekyll-and-Hyde figure: a brilliant legal mind but also a merciless executioner. Had the film focused on this dichotomy, it might have worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the film revolves around a fictitious love triangle. Jeffreys obsesses over Mary, a young peasant girl. Mary&amp;#39;s lover, Harry, is part of the rebellion. Jeffreys longs to arrest Harry, but Harry&amp;#39;s father is a political ally of Jeffreys. Instead, Jeffreys arrests Mary. Harry frees her. Jeffreys captures them both. They escape. Then the revolution happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also a blind oracle who may be psychic, and a man dressed like Boris Karloff in &lt;em&gt;The Tower of London (1939)&lt;/em&gt;, torturing a semi-nude woman covered in Technicolor blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mess of disparate plot-points has its roots in money. The production had multiple financiers, and each wanted a different film. One wanted a horror movie. Another wanted a historical drama. Yet another wanted an exploitation picture. The filmmakers tried to please everyone. At least no one wanted a comedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting compromise boils down to a string of overlong, exposition-leaden scenes interrupted by occasional bits of exploitation. Things pick up when the revolution gets underway, but not enough to recapture our interest. I can forgive stiff dialog, convoluted plotting, gratuitous nudity and violence. I can&amp;#39;t forgive boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding matters, Lee and director Jesús Franco disagreed on how to portray Jeffreys. Lee wanted historical accuracy. Franco wanted something more &amp;quot;dynamic.&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t know what Franco meant by &amp;quot;dynamic&amp;quot; and, judging by his performance, Lee didn&amp;#39;t either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider how Lee shifts his weight and looks uncomfortable whenever he sits down. In the DVD extras, Lee explains that Jeffreys suffered from kidney stones. Lee was a fine actor, but without script help, kidney stones is an impossible charade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financing amalgam also explains the myriad of alternate titles. In the United States it was &lt;em&gt;Night of the Blood Monster&lt;/em&gt;. In England it was &lt;em&gt;Witch Killer of Broadmoor&lt;/em&gt;, even though there&amp;#39;s no Broadmoor in the film. Granted, there&amp;#39;s no Blood Monster either, but why Broadmoor? That&amp;#39;s one question the DVD extras couldn&amp;#39;t answer.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story unfolds in a near-future overrun by vamps (think fast-running-zombies, but vampires). Enigmatic loner Mister befriends orphaned teen Martin. They head out in Mister&amp;#39;s old Cadillac, searching for the fabled sanctuary of New Eden. Along the way, they run up against a fundamentalist militia using vamps as weapons of mass destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It plays more like a western than horror. After a grisly opening sequence where a vamp drains an infant, the film keeps its baddies off-screen as much as possible. Instead, it relies on scenery to build atmosphere. Deserted strip malls. Desolate two-lane blacktops. Overgrown buildings. Rusted scrapheaps. An urban wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production values and supporting performances are better than the film&amp;#39;s all but straight-to-video release would suggest. And the script features moments of genuine inspiration. When Martin hears his family is “already dead,” he accepts it with wisdom seldom seen in horror films.  And don&amp;#39;t forget the part where the bad guys drop vampires from helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Stake Land&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#39;t without its problems. The voice-over narration feels unnecessary. And I couldn&amp;#39;t buy co-writer Nick Damici as Mister. His eyes betray the grizzled facade. Warren Oates would have been perfect, were he forty years younger and not dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hey, did I mention the bad guys drop vampires from helicopters?&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
