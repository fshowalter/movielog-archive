Straw Dogs (1971) ★★★★★</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/straw-dogs-1971//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/straw-dogs-1971/</id><updated>2016-12-19</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/straw-dogs-1971/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ypTOnjofVKo1mS6s5IGRxWK0rCGIoACFxoTqZk-laP8hnsVfBlsPNZkacAppZ1oqS3biEWAnzRPzsZjeMmZV2cLDTZQ7e_vZuIsFxkLYW7sTqEbq7L76oSnmhYcmsoawq1BIDQ=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Peckinpah&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Straw Dogs&lt;/em&gt; is an ugly, brutal, nihilistic horror film. It&amp;#39;s also brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horror fans will recognize the plot. A young couple moves to a small, isolated village where they hope to renovate an old house. They ignore repeated warnings to leave and bad things happen, culminating in the young lovers barricading themselves in their home, fighting to keep an unspeakable evil from gaining entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference is in the details. &lt;em&gt;Straw Dogs&lt;/em&gt; takes place in an English village; the quaint sort you see in romantic comedies. But instead of charming, quirky characters, the residents of this hamlet are leering, hard-drinking thugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Into this rural jungle comes mild-mannered American mathematician David (Dustin Hoffman) and his attractive wife Amy (Susan George). They&amp;#39;re fleeing some vague unrest in America and the village is her childhood home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we meet David and Amy, we get our first indication the film will stray from the formula. They aren&amp;#39;t the typical idyllic couple thrust into danger. David&amp;#39;s condescending manner alienates the few locals who would befriend him but he&amp;#39;s too self-absorbed to notice. His intellectual snobbery leads him to treat Amy like a child. Amy&amp;#39;s petulant responses only reinforce the behavior. Their bickering rings true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot kicks in when some local men, including a former boyfriend of Amy&amp;#39;s, named Charlie, worm their way into a job repairing the couple&amp;#39;s garage roof. The men drag out the work. They ogle Amy. One sneaks into the house and steals a pair of Amy&amp;#39;s panties, which he later flaunts at the pub. Things reach a tipping point when David and Amy discover their cat hung in their bedroom closet. When David proves reluctant to confront the men, Amy presses the issue. David snaps at her. She calls him a coward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conflict between David and Amy sets up the film&amp;#39;s most controversial scene: Charlie raping Amy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a hard scene to watch. I&amp;#39;ve seen the film multiple times, and it doesn&amp;#39;t get any easier. At first, Amy screams and fights back. Charlie slaps her and she crumbles to the floor in slow motion. Resigned to her fate, Amy stops fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Peckinpah twists the knife. He quick cuts between the present and Amy&amp;#39;s intimate memories of David. Amy&amp;#39;s anger toward David swirls and churns inside her. Her resignation turns to passion as she turns from victim to betrayer and embraces her former lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Peckinpah goes for the jugular. As Amy and Charlie lay entwined, one of Charlie&amp;#39;s goon friends enters, holding a shotgun. With some reluctance, Charlie steps aside and watches his friend force himself on Amy at gunpoint. Amy&amp;#39;s shrieks surround us as her violation is absolute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Controversial? Absolutely. Gratuitous? No. The scene is horrifying but necessary. It drives an unspoken wedge between David and Amy, setting up the rest of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finale sees Charlie and gang laying siege to David and Amy&amp;#39;s house. It&amp;#39;s a familiar scene in horror films; the men could just as easily be zombies or other monsters, and Peckinpah uses lots of low-angle shots and foggy backlighting. But the real horror isn&amp;#39;t what&amp;#39;s trying to get in, it&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s coming out between David and Amy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of plot-driven coincidences have led to David sheltering a mentally challenged man in the couple&amp;#39;s attic. The mob outside believes this man murdered a local girl earlier that evening. When the attacks start, Amy urges David to acquiesce to the mob&amp;#39;s demands and turn the man over, but David refuses. Bitter that David will stand up for a stranger but not her, Amy refuses to help. This proves the turning point in their relationship. Later, when Amy&amp;#39;s in trouble, she yells for Charlie. It&amp;#39;s a gut-punch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to dismiss &lt;em&gt;Straw Dogs&lt;/em&gt; as misogynistic, but that&amp;#39;s short-sighted. This film hates everyone. While Amy is assaulted, David&amp;#39;s out hunting with the very men who attack her. Of course, the trip was just a ruse to lure him away, but David only accepted to buddy-up with alpha-male Charlie. David would label himself a pacifist but behaves as a sycophant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that goes to what makes the film special. It&amp;#39;s violent, sure, but it&amp;#39;s not the violence that stays with you. Rather, it&amp;#39;s the bleak reflection of human nature. Horror movies tend to paint their protagonists as bland, cookie-cutter stereotypes; their misfortune born out of some trespass or bad luck. Not here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horror of &lt;em&gt;Straw Dogs&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#39;t that it could &lt;em&gt;happen&lt;/em&gt; to us, it&amp;#39;s that the characters could &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; us. By committing to its bleak vision the film projects authority. By making its protagonists monsters themselves, the film transcends the exploitation genre. It may not be entertaining in the conventional sense, but every viewing stays with me for days. I may not like what &lt;em&gt;Straw Dogs&lt;/em&gt; is saying, but I can&amp;#39;t deny its impact.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: A+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Getaway (1972) ★★★★</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-getaway-1972//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-getaway-1972/</id><updated>2016-12-05</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-getaway-1972/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3H45oFIj7vXiyg8k4jQ31wblut4vMmI4hmwq_h-b17Q6U78pSN1GXsntFrNmU-QCpQNQnGj_9-Pi=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Getaway&lt;/em&gt; is a slick bit of neo-noir exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve McQueen stars as Doc McCoy, an incarcerated bank robber. The opening credit sequence--cut to the staccato rhythm of an industrial loom--hammers home the hellish, regimented existence of prison life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doc finds himself near breaking after his expected parole is denied. When his wife Carol (Ali McGraw) visits him in jail, Doc cuts the visit short, telling her to contact a man named Beynon and tell him “I&amp;#39;m for sale. His price.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beynon (Ben Johnson) is a greasy operator who sits on the parole board. He pulls some strings and Doc is paroled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doc&amp;#39;s reunion with Carol is a touch of genuine sweetness that transcends the film&amp;#39;s exploitative nature. The near-wordless scenes convey the sudden change in their lives. Reunited, the two experience a brief respite before Doc meets with Beynon to repay his debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job is a local bank. Beynon has already picked the crew. Doc would rather use his own guys, but Beynon won&amp;#39;t budge. With no leverage, Doc agrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The robbery, of course, goes wrong. One of Beynon&amp;#39;s guys panics. Things get bloody. In his trademark fashion, director Sam Peckinpah renders each fatality in graphic slow motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty minutes into the film, the real story begins. Doc and Carol head for Mexico with the loot. The law and Beynon&amp;#39;s gang pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love how the film avoids painting Doc as a hero. He kills without hesitation. There&amp;#39;s even a rough scene where smacks Carol. And yet, McQueen&amp;#39;s performance engenders sympathy. You sense Doc&amp;#39;s desire to be a better man but fear he&amp;#39;ll lose the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s part of the film&amp;#39;s overall sense of dread. In pursuit of Doc, one of Beynon&amp;#39;s gang takes a husband and wife hostage. The wife falls for their captor, degrading herself and humiliating her husband. As Doc and Carol flee, you&amp;#39;re sure they won&amp;#39;t make it. Even when they escape, you&amp;#39;re certain the next close-call will be their last. Chalk that up to Peckinpah&amp;#39;s commitment to grounding the film in a plausible reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sets look worn and dusty. The characters glisten with a perpetual sheen of sweat from the oppressive Texas heat. They eat greasy cheeseburgers, hole up in dingy motels, and travel in oversized cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And those cars make for gripping chase scenes. As characters panic, oversteer, fishtail, and crash, you appreciate the challenge of controlling such large vehicles at high speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the film&amp;#39;s highlight belongs to an on-foot chase. After a con-man switches locker keys with Carol and snags the loot, Doc engages in a desperate pursuit through a crowded train station. The dialog-free sequence crackles with tension and echoes vintage Hitchcock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenes like this, along with McQueen&amp;#39;s charisma and Peckinpah&amp;#39;s stylish editing help gloss over the clunky plot. &lt;em&gt;The Getaway&lt;/em&gt; may be little more than pulp, but it&amp;#39;s damn entertaining.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>71. Doctor Strange (2016) ★★★</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/doctor-strange-2016//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/doctor-strange-2016/</id><updated>2016-11-28</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/doctor-strange-2016/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Fy7FUeNQVfMdLwIj_JHquTJoXwp0DquRwvPVURemABSX3aw-9se2e0xZrv-idwOmD1gjJ8T39OCv=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt; offers ephemeral entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in the Marvel cinematic universe, the film stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange, a hotshot neurosurgeon. After a car accident cripples his hands, Strange’s desperate search for a miracle cure leads him to Nepal. There he meets The Ancient One, played by Tilda Swinton, who trains him in the mystic arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strange proves himself an exceptional student. Good thing, as he’s soon under attack from Kaecilius, the Ancient One’s former star pupil. Kaecilius now serves Dormammu, an ancient entity from the Dark Dimension. Soon, Strange is all that stands between Earth and a horrible (but not well explained) fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen this story before in countless martial arts films. An acolyte approaches a great master for training, excels against the odds, then clashes with the master’s once favorite student. This film merely substitutes magic for kung-fu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem lies in the homogenized and watered-down execution. Strange’s arc revolves around him overcoming his arrogance. But the film paints him as a brilliant surgeon far ahead of his colleagues. Is that arrogance? Why not paint Strange as a real monster? The film doesn’t seem comfortable making Strange too unlikable. Thus, Cumberbatch’s Strange plays as a less fun version of Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark from the &lt;em&gt;Iron Man&lt;/em&gt; films. The resulting character feels thin and flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extends to the villains. Mads Mikkelsen can play a great bad guy but fails to register as Kaecilius. The script gives him no edge. We’ve seen the disgruntled student archetype in countless films before, and &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt; offers nothing new. Even Dormammu, who should rank among the most horrific villains in the Marvel oeuvre, fails to terrify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The special effects also fail to connect. We see cities twisting and folding upon themselves like Rubik’s Cubes, but the film fails to surround these scenes with a compelling story. Watching New York transform into an M.C. Escher style visage is impressive, but not engaging. The effects should serve the story, not substitute for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds like I hated the film. I did not. Though I would have preferred his native British accent, I enjoyed Cumberbatch’s performance. The real star, however, is Tilda Swinton. She takes a throw-away archetype and delivers the film’s most memorable character. And as someone who grew up reading the comics, I loved seeing the sentient Cloak of Levitation, even if it was little more than comic relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, after the obligatory post-credit sequence, I left the theater impressed with &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt;. But in retrospect, I could remember images in the film, but none of my feelings upon seeing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a reoccurring effect in the film where characters enter the Astral Plane. Their ethereal bodies float in the air and pass through solid objects. If they try hard enough, they can bump walls or knock things over. It’s an apt enough metaphor for the film. It looks good, but it’s hollow inside and struggles to connect. When you try to grab it, you discover there’s nothing there.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>70. Sagebrush Trail (1933) ★★★</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/sagebrush-trail-1933//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/sagebrush-trail-1933/</id><updated>2016-11-21</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/sagebrush-trail-1933/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/t-YlFZzOBSK4QJXy7XZhfQhiwqqlYvXoJF85WXSfOPlWXg3hHjw5PbUBFp96zepLn2A6HWSVaxG3=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The underwater scenes in &lt;em&gt;Sagebrush Trail&lt;/em&gt; belie its shoestring budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those scenes come early. John Wayne plays a fugitive named John (of course) stowed away aboard a freight train. As the train pulls into the station, lawmen are waiting. After some cat and mouse, John hops a horse and flees into the countryside. The lawmen pursue. John dead-ends at a lake, dismounts, and dives into the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see John underwater, breathing through a reed. It&amp;#39;s not a special effect. I&amp;#39;m not sure how they shot these scenes, but that&amp;#39;s Wayne underwater, breathing through a stick in what looks like a lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After eluding the lawmen, who believe him dead, John surfaces and encounters a gunslinger. The gunslinger, recognizing a fellow desperado, introduces himself as Jones and invites John to join an outlaw gang. John accepts and he and Jones become fast-friends and rivals for the local shopgirl, Sally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, John&amp;#39;s not really a bad guy. He passes notes to Sally warning her of the gang&amp;#39;s intentions. And of course, it was Jones who committed the crime pinned on John. And of course, John doesn&amp;#39;t discover this until the second act&amp;#39;s end. But you know what? I didn&amp;#39;t mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sagebrush Trail&lt;/em&gt; may suffer from predictable plotting, stilted dialog, and fight scenes where the participants punch each other&amp;#39;s shoulders, but I still enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the aforementioned underwater scenes, I liked the location photography and wipe transitions. And the script&amp;#39;s making Jones a flawed but likable character was a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most of all, I liked Wayne. This was his second production for Monogram Pictures, after &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/riders-of-destiny-1933/&quot;&gt;Riders of Destiny (1933)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Though Wayne struggles with the romantic comedy scenes, he&amp;#39;s making strides as a performer. More than ever before, we see flashes of his famous Duke persona. And judging by the underwater scenes, he&amp;#39;s doing some of his own stunts to boot.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>69. The Sentinel (1977) ★★★</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-sentinel-1977//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-sentinel-1977/</id><updated>2016-11-14</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-sentinel-1977/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kxf7iIKKYoFRZdgn7mW5D-IVUDAGpSn0VjUjuQp1L5vB-Mooasc61eOcROuNr7gtSs9VcbwociKh=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Sarandon saves &lt;em&gt;The Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; from its own excess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film stars Cristina Raines as a fashion model who moves into a fantastic apartment in a converted Brooklyn brownstone. A series of strange encounters with her eccentric neighbors leaves her paranoid and on edge. Her boyfriend, a hot-shot defense attorney played by Sarandon, investigates and uncovers a horrific conspiracy involving the Catholic Church and a gateway to Hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setup invites comparisons to &lt;em&gt;Rosemary’s Baby (1968)&lt;/em&gt;. But unlike that film, which was about women&amp;#39;s reproductive rights, &lt;em&gt;The Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#39;t about anything. It&amp;#39;s an exploitation picture offering a smorgasbord of gore, nudity, lesbianism, human deformities, and female masturbation. I don&amp;#39;t mind these things. I object to the film’s middling execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movie fans will enjoy spotting the once and future stars peppering the cast. José Ferrer as an unnamed robed figure. Ava Gardner as a charming real estate agent. Burgess Meredith as a creepy neighbor. Eli Wallach as a cagey detective. Christopher Walken as Wallach’s grinning partner. Jeff Goldblum as a fashion photographer. Beverly D’Angelo as a mute exhibitionist. An unrecognizable John Carradine as an aging priest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the film wastes its talented ensemble. It regulates most of the former stars, like Ferrer, Gardner, and Carradine, to throwaway roles for name recognition. Other performances veer into camp. Beverly D’Angelo’s memorable scene elicits chuckles instead of chills. Eli Wallach&amp;#39;s phoned-in turn plays as caricature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sprawling cast is a byproduct of the convoluted, nonsensical plot. Consider the scene where a character breaks through a wall in the brownstone and uncovers a plaque bearing an inscription from Dante’s &lt;em&gt;Inferno&lt;/em&gt;. It’s the film in a microcosm: effective and atmospheric, but its logic crumbles under the slightest scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What saved the film for me was Sarandon. Despite sporting a mustache that only adds to the film&amp;#39;s second-rate feel, Sarandon is perfect in his role. He avoids the idiot plot and acts according to character. And there&amp;#39;s just something about him playing a charming but ruthless character that I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I saw &lt;em&gt;The Sentinel&lt;/em&gt;, I thought its mix of camp and shock hit more often than it missed—if only just. Watching it again, I’m not so sure. The performances don’t hold up well to repeat viewings, but Sarandon was every bit as good as I remembered.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>68. Curse of the Demon (1958) ★★★★</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/curse-of-the-demon-1958//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/curse-of-the-demon-1958/</id><updated>2016-11-07</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/curse-of-the-demon-1958/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Qyy-4N8MQjl3tTIF-bHyjNuAgoZghlz7L_FdCwONdmhmLDcEex-ieWdSWnPa0XmPI6m3Tc3ZplgA=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;A producer&amp;#39;s meddling keeps &lt;em&gt;Curse of the Demon&lt;/em&gt; from perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story sees American psychologist John Holden (Dana Andrews) travel to London. He&amp;#39;s there to expose self-professed black magician Julian Karswell (Niall MacGinnis) as a fraud. Karswell tries to dissuade Holden, but Holden remains resolute. Karswell then announces Holden will die in three days. Holden is skeptical, but after a series of unexplained events, his skepticism crumbles and he begins to fear for his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the best kind of thriller: one populated by intelligent characters who behave according to their personalities, not the whims of the plot. It avoids cheap jump-scares. Instead, director Jacques Tourneur uses atmosphere to build tension. Shadowy hallways and darkened rooms keep us on edge. And, for the real horror, there&amp;#39;s Niall MacGinnis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved MacGinnis&amp;#39; performance. It&amp;#39;s a perfect combination of charm and menace. There&amp;#39;s a great scene where Holden has broken into Karswell&amp;#39;s palatial home. In the darkness, a house cat transforms into a leopard and attacks. Holden struggles for his life, only escaping once Karswell enters and turns on the lights. Karswell treats the intruding Holden as one would treat a party guest who&amp;#39;d gotten lost looking for the bathroom. By underplaying the role, MacGinnis makes the character all the more sinister. Christopher Lee built a career on similar performances. And yet, MacGinnis conveys a vulnerability beneath the bluster that adds unexpected depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opposite MacGinnis, Andrews delivers a curious turn. His cadence and speech patterns mimic John Wayne&amp;#39;s. They&amp;#39;re so similar, I wonder if it was a deliberate impersonation. This brings up an interesting tangent. The Duke played many roles in many movies, but he never made a straight horror picture. Judging by Andrews&amp;#39; performance here, Wayne could have pulled it off with flair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite the solid script, competent direction and inspired performances, &lt;em&gt;Curse of the Demon&lt;/em&gt; falters. The opening sequence sees the titular demon marching out of the woods. A similar sequence occurs at the film&amp;#39;s end. In both, the demon’s mechanical movement and frozen expression scream rubber suit. My wife thought it resembled a homecoming float. Not only do these shots cheapen the film, they undermine any sense of ambiguity regarding Karswell&amp;#39;s powers. Holden is the audience surrogate. His skepticism is our skepticism. But this falls apart when we know Karswell&amp;#39;s powers are real from the outset. Instead of questioning things along with Holden, we grow impatient waiting for him to catch up. A great psychological thriller devolves into a cheap monster movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can thank producer Hal E. Chester. He added the demon shots after principal photography wrapped. Tourneur and Andrews fought him on it. Writer Charles Bennett threatened to shoot Chester dead. They all lost. The studio, Columbia, did cut some footage for the American release, but not of the monster. What a shame.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>67. Torso (1973) ★★★★</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/torso-1973//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/torso-1973/</id><updated>2016-10-31</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/torso-1973/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Y_IbflpaJ_iIgxd1thi7OTYEH7xp1iHj-4VSR24Zf_hdegkTj4DiKnlsPbZDUSWau43K9mlO7qXu=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Torso&lt;/em&gt; executes a generic plot with panache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film takes place in scenic Perugia, Italy. A masked killer strangles two female university students, sparking a manhunt. Another student thinks she recognizes the murder weapon, leading to threatening phone calls from the killer. Alarmed, she retreats to a cliff-side villa with four girlfriends, including an American exchange student, played by Suzy Kendall. The killer, of course, follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It plays as a mystery, inviting us to guess the killer’s identity. The script proffers a myriad of suspects, painting almost every male character as possessive, misogynistic, or perverted. The few that appear normal feel suspect by comparison. I admit, it fooled me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mystery aside, what I enjoyed most about &lt;em&gt;Torso&lt;/em&gt; was its style. There’s a scene where the killer tracks a girl through a swampy marsh. The lighting, camerawork, and editing create a kind of kinetic claustrophobia. The more she runs, the more her world shrinks. Even as the tension held me rapt, the sheer craft made me smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it gets better. The last act sees Kendall locked in a bedroom. She slides a piece of newspaper under the door, hoping to catch the key as she forces it out of the lock. I won&amp;#39;t spoil what happens, but I will say this scene caps twenty-some dialog-free minutes that serve as a master class in suspense. They&amp;#39;re so good, I forgave the finale, which sees the killer reveal his identity and explain his psychosis via some awkward and disappointing exposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only problem with &lt;em&gt;Torso&lt;/em&gt; lies with its heroines. I liked how the film paints them as strong, independent women. Fleeing to a remote outpost wasn&amp;#39;t the smartest move, but it was refreshing to see them do something besides run to the nearest man for protection. If only the script had provided them with distinct personalities. Aside from Kendall’s character, they felt interchangeable and never endeared themselves. It’s a common problem with mysteries. We learn more about the various red herrings than about the protagonists.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Pit (1981) ★★★</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-pit-1981//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-pit-1981/</id><updated>2016-10-24</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-pit-1981/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RWu-i9XAIElgsPF4HpQlnhdTYfxFpZP8rncZVWqoLYegY2CFhA4z3m181oKEfq5twCg1-2PXioSr=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pit&lt;/em&gt; careens between laughable and disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We meet Jamie, a twelve-year-old boy transitioning to adolescence. He’s noticed girls and nudie-books, but still clings to his teddy bear. When his parents take a trip, Jamie develops a crush on the live-in babysitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a reasonable set-up for a coming-of-age comedy, but the script takes a different direction. Jamie’s teddy bear urges him to do things. Bad things, like watch his babysitter while she sleeps, or terrorize a neighbor into stripping nude as he snaps Polaroids, or frame a man for murder, or feed people to a pit of trolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way the movie lumps the titular pit in with Jamie’s other deviations is part of its quirky charm. The troll effects look cheap, and the entire premise of luring people into a giant hole in the woods is silly. It’s as though the filmmakers knew they couldn’t make these bits scary, so they opted for weird. It works. Instead of a forgettable monster movie we get oddball schlock. And I love how obnoxious the film paints Jamie’s victims. Early on, Jamie, looking lonesome, approaches an older boy and girl. Jamie says little more than “Hi,” before the older boy punches him in the face. No reason, the boy’s just mean. When Jamie feeds him to the trolls, we’re not sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s another movie lurking beneath the inanity. A much darker one. Bits and pieces surface, like Jamie alluding to his mother molesting him, or the aforementioned scene where he watches his babysitter sleep. These scenes transcend the schlock and convey a genuine sense of unease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, &lt;em&gt;The Pit&lt;/em&gt; is unlike anything I’ve seen. It’s not a good film, but its off-beat nature intrigues. You laugh as Jamie wheels an old biddy into the pit, then feel your skin crawl as he hits on his babysitter. It’s a wild ride.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Phantasm (1979) ★★★★</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/phantasm-1979//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/phantasm-1979/</id><updated>2016-10-17</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/phantasm-1979/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IVL-n1s23XRh7rcJSbW0dd8L3wFqy6hiU7HbYF-bJg6XfZgWI7JOTI0XLhTRis5qXDs_3X5ShVAz=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was still watching Saturday morning cartoons and struggling with cursive writing when I first saw &lt;em&gt;Phantasm&lt;/em&gt;. It traumatized  me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s told from a kid’s point-of view. A boy who’s put away his toys but hasn&amp;#39;t yet discovered girls. His parents died a few months earlier in a car crash. Now, he follows his older brother everywhere. In the process, he uncovers some strange goings-on involving the local mortician, played by Angus Scrimm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love how writer-director Don Coscarelli avoids traditional plot tropes. When no one believes him, the kid breaks into the mortuary. After evading a lethal flying ball, he escapes with a gruesome piece of evidence. The next morning, he shows his older brother, who takes a single look and says, “Okay, I believe you.” A lesser film would see the boy lose the evidence during his escape, or have the older brother dismiss it with some awkward rationalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t reveal any more of the plot, as much of the film&amp;#39;s joy comes from the unexpected directions it takes. It plays like a surreal nightmare. Scenes feel disjointed. We often sense we’re missing something. These seeming plot holes only add to the film’s unrelenting sense of unease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it’s often lumped in with the slasher pictures that dominated early 80s horror, &lt;em&gt;Phantasm&lt;/em&gt; stands apart. It’s equal parts science fiction and dark fantasy. Take out the brief nudity and iconic chrome ball, and you&amp;#39;d have a PG-13 film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But about that ball. Those with squeamish stomachs may find it rough. As a special effect, it’s a collision of imagination,  exploitation, and blood. Lots of blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ball pushed my younger self over the edge. I had nightmares for weeks. So much of the film, from the stark white mortuary interiors to Scrimm himself, looks unsettling. It sounds unsettling too, with an ominous, disconcerting score that adds to the film&amp;#39;s impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching it now, &lt;em&gt;Phantasm&lt;/em&gt; plays like a remake of the film I saw as a child. Scenes tug at memories of a more brutal experience. One that carved itself into my malleable psyche and sewed the seeds of my predilection for nihilistic, nightmarish horror. &lt;em&gt;Phantasm&lt;/em&gt; may not be perfect, but it made an impression.

</content></entry><entry><title>64. Mars Attacks! (1996) ★★★</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/mars-attacks-1996//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/mars-attacks-1996/</id><updated>2016-10-10</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/mars-attacks-1996/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UaIryK7fdz3ppPVenyCpIZH8N_igIhz5H5gSo31rmY4OQilJabolh4ji7z45AKK3ztNCGlMDiHOQ=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mars Attacks!&lt;/em&gt; could have been awful but settles for mediocre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film jumps between several storylines as aliens from Mars attack Earth. We follow the President and his staff, a pair of television personalities, a family in rural Kansas, a sleazy Las Vegas developer, and a washed up heavyweight boxer. Jack Nicholson leads an all-star cast as both the President and the Vegas developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The studio advertised the film as spoofing 1950s science-fiction pictures, but it doesn’t play that way. Among the cast, it&amp;#39;s telling that amateur actor and former NFL fullback Jim Brown seems the most comfortable. He plays the boxer reduced to dressing as a pharaoh for an Egyptian-themed casino. When the Martians attack, Brown heads out to reunite with his ex-wife (Pam Grier) and kids. He gets some help from Tom Jones, who plays himself. There’s a wonderful scene where Brown asks Jones, “Do you know how to fly a plane?” to which Jones replies, “Of course! You got one?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of goofball casting matches the goofy sci-fi premise.  Brown and Jones both seem aware of their shortcomings as actors, and their stiff performances are genuine and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a glimpse of the movie I suspect director Tim Burton wanted to make. He seems less interested in spoofing the genre than recreating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not a bad idea, but no one told the big-name cast. Few appear to enjoy the material. Most convey a sense of condescension, their performances screaming “I’m overacting on purpose!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did they have a choice? Unlike Brown and Jones, the rest of the cast can’t pretend they’re amateurs. And playing it straight wouldn’t have helped. Pam Grier plays her role with such conviction, her scenes feel spliced in from a different film. Martin Short plays his role as though he were in an overt comedy, to similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least they got the Martians right. The 1950s films featured serious monsters cobbled together with silly effects. Here, we get cartoonish villains brought to life with no visible wires, seams, or zippers. In my favorite scene, the Martians laser a national monument, catch the falling debris with their flying saucer, and redirect the rubble onto a fleeing tour group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, &lt;em&gt;Mars Attacks!&lt;/em&gt; underwhelms. It’s a rare movie that would be much better were it much worse.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
