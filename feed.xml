&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph Trail&lt;/em&gt; was the fourth production, following &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-big-stampede-1932/&quot;&gt;The Big Stampede (1932)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, under a six-picture contract Wayne signed with Warner Bros. It recycles footage from Ken Maynard&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Red Raiders (1927)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Warner Bros. acquired First National Pictures a few years prior, they inherited the rights to several popular silent westerns starring Maynard. These were A-list productions showcasing Maynard&amp;#39;s impressive stunt work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warner Bros. figured they could save money by reusing the Maynard action footage in new pictures. They just needed an actor who matched Maynard&amp;#39;s build. Enter Wayne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This picture sees Wayne play calvary scout John Trent. When his comrade and good pal Jonesy is killed to prevent completion of a telegraph line, Trent and his buddy Tippy (Frank McHugh) set out to apprehend the culprits. Along the way, they encounter hostile natives incited by corrupt trader Gus Lynch (Albert J. Smith). There&amp;#39;s also the obligatory love interest for Wayne, played by Alice Keller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wayne&amp;#39;s prior pictures for Warner Bros. saddled him with subpar supporting casts, but this time he gets McHugh, a great character actor, and Smith, a great heavy. But the lackluster result proves Wayne still had lots to learn. It doesn&amp;#39;t help that he and Keller have minimal chemistry, or that the finale drags on far too long and reuses the same recycled footage multiple times. Later in his career, Wayne could have carried the film, but at this point, he struggles to hold his own.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe not exactly, but I admired the gumption. Few films would dare hurtle so far over the top, and if they dared, they&amp;#39;d build up to it. &lt;em&gt;Island of Death&lt;/em&gt; gives us that scene in the first 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to make an unintentional parody? Director Nico Mastorakis offers no indication he sought to satirize the exploitation horror genre, but his film is so ridiculous, modern horror audiences are bound to take it as comedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot concerns a young couple played by Behling and Jane Lyle who arrive on the Greek island of Mykonos and embark on a thrill-kill spree. That&amp;#39;s it. It doesn&amp;#39;t pretend to have a deeper purpose or meaning. It&amp;#39;s all shock for shock&amp;#39;s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, it&amp;#39;s surprisingly well done. Mastorakis makes terrific use of the photogenic locales and enlivens the over-the-top violence with inventive camerawork. Consider the nocturnal chase through the city&amp;#39;s labyrinthine alleys. Mastorakis heightens the sense of panic by using a fish-eye lens and several low-angles shots from the victim&amp;#39;s point-of-view. In a lesser film, such choices would feel gimmicky, but they work here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assured photography contrasts with the uneven performances. Though the supporting players are either wooden or over-the-top, Behling and Lyle play their parts so straight they verge on camp. As parody, the performances are inspired. Behling&amp;#39;s delivery alone is priceless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By his own account, Mastorakis made &lt;em&gt;Island of Death&lt;/em&gt; after seeing &lt;em&gt;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)&lt;/em&gt;. That film&amp;#39;s box-office success lead him to believe an even more extreme picture would make even more money. This naked ambition manifests in an everything-but-the-kitchen sink approach that pushes the film past any genuine scares or mean-spirited umbrage, and firmly into parody. Were I to enumerate the film&amp;#39;s assorted affronts to good taste it would appear brutal, yet I came away entertained. &lt;em&gt;Island of Death&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#39;t for everyone, but exploitation fans will love it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It started with an internet movie review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Collins publishes &lt;a href=&quot;http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Horror Movie a Day&lt;/a&gt;. For the site&amp;#39;s first six years, Collins watched and reviewed a horror movie every single day. Two months into his run, buried in a fifty-film “Chilling Classics” DVD pack, Collins discovered &lt;em&gt;Cathy&amp;#39;s Curse&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com/2007/04/cathys-curse.html&quot;&gt;His review&lt;/a&gt; crowned it the “Best/Worst” film he&amp;#39;d seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Cathy&amp;#39;s Curse&lt;/em&gt; was a cult film, Collins became the cult leader. As his site&amp;#39;s audience grew, Collins kept recommending the film and even posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com/2009/03/cathys-curse-commentary-now-live.html&quot;&gt;a commentary track&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this exposure convinced Severin Films to acquire the rights and sponsor a 2k restoration.  In recognition of Collins&amp;#39; efforts, they invited him to record a new audio commentary for the Blu-ray release. Said release also included a limited theatrical run, which is how I found myself watching &lt;em&gt;Cathy&amp;#39;s Curse&lt;/em&gt; on the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story follows a couple and their young daughter as they move back into the husband&amp;#39;s childhood home. A malevolent spirit possesses the daughter leading to lots of profanity, extreme acne, and several unexplained deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s as bad as &lt;a href=&quot;http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com/2007/04/cathys-curse.html&quot;&gt;Collins&amp;#39; review&lt;/a&gt; claims, with inane dialog, incomprehensible editing, and whiplash performances. Aside from one scene, where a drunken groundskeeper finds himself covered in snakes and spiders, it&amp;#39;s a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, I found myself bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cathy&amp;#39;s Curse&lt;/em&gt; achieved cult status as a so-bad-it&amp;#39;s-good film. One with flaws so obvious and fixable, it was as though the filmmakers were blissful idiots. But watching the restored digital projection, the film looked too good. Cleaning up the picture made the film feel less like an inept amateur effort and more like a lazy professional one. The added scenes smoothed over the worst editing mishaps but added to the film&amp;#39;s glacial pacing. Several scenes elicit laughs, but they&amp;#39;re few and farther between. It&amp;#39;s still bad, but so-bad-it&amp;#39;s-good? Not so much.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Then I realized he makes the film work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picking up where &lt;em&gt;John Wick (2014)&lt;/em&gt; ended, we follow John Wick as he rebuilds his house, sends his car for repairs, and tries to resume a normal life. I liked how these scenes acknowledge the mess action pictures leave in their wake. But soon enough, a smarmy mafioso appears, calling in a marker and forcing Wick back into life as an assassin. We meet a delightful array of supporting characters and thrill as Wick offs dozens of bad guys using knives, guns, cars, pens—you name it—before an obligatory double-cross makes him the target of every assassin in New York City. The film doesn’t so much end as set up another installment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may read like a direct-to-video production, but &lt;em&gt;John Wick: Chapter 2&lt;/em&gt; transcends the action genre, thanks to Reeves. It starts with the cognitive dissonance he creates. How he marches through the film with a shadow limp. The closeups that betray his fifty-two years. The weariness behind his eyes that clashes with his surfer-dude delivery. How nothing in the film surprises him. I have a theory that ties it all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider, if you will, that the John Wick universe, with its surreal characters, superhuman assassins, and over-the-top violence, isn’t attempting to pass as real. And consider further that the John Wick character isn’t reluctant to kill out of a moral quandary, but because he knows he can’t lose. In this respect, Reeves’ weary delivery fits perfectly. How many times has he played this story out? His final line, saying “I’ll kill them all,” isn’t a warning or a threat, but a plea. He’s already killed them all, countless times. He’s a self-aware action hero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, it’s a stretch, and the third installment will likely prove me wrong, but I’m looking forward to it, regardless.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>Maléfique (2002)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/malefique-2002//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/malefique-2002/</id><updated>2017-02-13</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/malefique-2002/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Gx06bofb27ZJC9m3SnJeq2c5Tjq18GTibJ62vv2xS-WdKgXvV0vx82TOGyAgOdrdj4CMNEdZ_u6EqLWjfB5v93R4UVdPXSXzzbW2DWBvukA5NbVvpBtdFpusoEceSq1EhLMQ_g=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maléfique&lt;/em&gt; falls short of its potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film opens with a man saying goodbye to his wife and young son. The man’s name is Carrère. He is a white-collar criminal and today marks his first day in prison. We meet his cellmates: Lassalle, an older librarian who says little, Marcus, a brash young man whose large breast implants clash with his brawny physique, and Pâquerette, a man-child with a penchant for eating things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After establishing these characters and their interpersonal dynamics, the plot kicks into gear. The men discover an old diary that doubles as a spell book. Eager to escape, the men try some incantations but discover magic carries a high cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I relished this premise. Taking four desperate (but not fierce) men and dangling a supernatural means of escape overflows with potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carrère and Lassalle are well-cast. As Carrère, Gérald Laroche provides a grounded audience surrogate whose gradual transformation into a bitter convict carries the film. As Lassalle, Philippe Laudenbach adds gravitas, communicating volumes with his weary looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was fine with Clovis Cornillac as Marcus, but his character felt underwritten—his transgenderedness regulated to a plot device. As Pâquerette, Dimitri Rataud’s performance felt artificial. I kept hoping the film would reveal Pâquerette as a calculating mastermind masquerading as an imbecile, but no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the story devolves into a predictable version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey&#39;s_Paw&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Monkey’s Paw&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. What begins with echoes of Lovecraft ends like an episode of &lt;em&gt;Tales from the Crypt&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a film that took these characters—one imprisoned in his body, one in his mind, one in his wealth—and explored their prisons and the lengths they would go for freedom. &lt;em&gt;Maléfique&lt;/em&gt; is not that movie. It’s not a bad film, just a disappointing one.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director Dario Argento&amp;#39;s debut feature stars Tony Musante as Sam, an American writer living in Rome. Walking the streets one night, Sam passes an art gallery. Glancing inside, he spies a mysterious black-clad assailant attacking a woman with a knife. Unable to gain entry, Sam stands helpless as the attacker escapes and the woman lies bleeding on the floor pleading for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haunted by his memories, Sam joins the investigation, causing the killer to target him and his live-in girlfriend, played by Suzy Kendall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argento&amp;#39;s visual style grabs you from the get-go. Consider the art gallery scene. The establishing shot sees a bright light shining out of the building&amp;#39;s glass facade, drawing our eyes along with Sam&amp;#39;s. Inside, the woman&amp;#39;s white dress blends with the white walls and floor, forcing our gaze to the black-clad assailant and the woman&amp;#39;s crimson blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a terrific use of contrast; a technique that Argento perfects in my favorite shot, which I shall endeavor to describe. It occurs later in the film, Sam has tracked the killer into a darkened room. As Sam enters, Argento cuts to a wide shot. The only light comes from the doorway. Sam&amp;#39;s silhouette moves to the center of the otherwise pitch-black screen. Then the lights come on and the colors reverse to startling effect. That Argento would even try such a tricky shot shows his confidence. That he pulls it off heralds a major talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Argento&amp;#39;s visual focus can also be a detriment, particularly when he treats his characters as props rather than people. The most grievous example comes when Suzy Kendall&amp;#39;s character finds herself under siege by the killer. She flees into her apartment and locks and barricades the heavy door. She looks for another way out. Finding none, she crumbles to the bathroom floor and sobs hysterically while the killer stabs at the apartment door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, Argento gets some memorable shots of a wide-eyed Kendall clinging to the bathroom sink, but the scene lost me. By having her scour the apartment for an exit, Argento reveals the lack of another &lt;em&gt;entry&lt;/em&gt;. After locking and barricading the door, she need only grab a weapon and wait. Granted, it might be a long wait—boring through inches of hardwood with a kitchen knife takes time—but should the killer poke a limb through, she could stab or bludgeon it. Instead, Argento has her wail around on the floor as though the killer were literally breathing down her neck. What begins tense and stylish, drags and devolves into overwrought indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This illustrates a fundamental misconception on Argento&amp;#39;s part: that showing us a terrified character is enough to make &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; terrified. It&amp;#39;s not, and such moments mar an otherwise inventive thriller.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>Men Are Such Fools (1938)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/men-are-such-fools-1938//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/men-are-such-fools-1938/</id><updated>2017-01-30</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/men-are-such-fools-1938/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3FPwrWzQNStn2lXQpbglpZstCqPhhoxtLlX2deGZeMRTD7NGhKANft7glVrrgEO3O1qQQwicVHWz9KxxXuTYsulEDDLfdtarMDMDbjtJK99aJZ9O6UrM7TcaoklxZRFn2i2SAQ=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two-piece bathing suit isn’t worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, it’s good for a laugh. Seeing Humphrey Bogart shed his terry cloth trench coat to reveal a deep-cut two-piece is comedy gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the movie surrounding this scene? I watched it some years back and thought it awful. Revisiting it for this review reaffirmed my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priscilla Lane stars as Linda, a secretary in an advertising agency who dreams of climbing the corporate ladder and drawing a salary instead of wages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as her career takes off, she marries Jimmy, played by Wayne Morris. Jimmy is an ex-footballer from Princeton turned ad-man. When Linda works overtime and misses the big Princeton football game, Jimmy demands Linda quit her job. Linda agrees, and several months later they’ve settled into a bland suburban existence with Linda playing the role of dutiful housewife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still ambitious, Linda arranges a promising business venture for Jimmy, but Jimmy turns it down. Furious, Linda leaves Jimmy and resumes her career. Soon, she’s near the top of the ladder, working long nights alongside fellow advertising executive Harry, played by Bogart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despondent, Jimmy throws himself into his work and achieves a large measure of success. As Harry makes his feelings for Linda clear, Linda realizes she’ll have to choose between Harry and Jimmy. She chooses poorly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romantic comedies require us to like at least one of the leads. In &lt;em&gt;Men Are Such Fools&lt;/em&gt;, I loathed them both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jimmy displays no regard for Linda’s dreams and ambitions, behaving as though he’s entitled to her attention and affection. When Linda cancels a dinner date with Jimmy to sell her boss on an ad campaign, Jimmy crashes the meeting. When a senior executive talks to Linda at a party, Jimmy sulks in a corner rather than join in the conversation. And don’t forget Linda&amp;#39;s near-unforgivable crime of missing the Princeton game with Jimmy and his fraternity buddies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jimmy’s so chauvinistic it’s almost comical. But everyone in the film acts as though his behavior is acceptable. They laugh and chalk it up to young love. That’s when you realize it’s not Jimmy who’s supposed to be funny, but Linda for prioritizing her career over a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to Linda, who I loathed even more than Jimmy. You see, she doesn’t endure his behavior, she encourages it. Consider how Jimmy gets her to marry him. They’re at a pool party thrown by one of Linda’s bosses. Linda’s talking to a high level executive. Furious that Linda would dare talk to another man, Jimmy stalks across the party, grabs Linda, pulls her into the pool and demands she marry him. When Linda says no, he pushes her head under water. He waits a beat, then lets her up. As Linda gasps for air, Jimmy repeats his demand. Again she says no. Back under she goes. This repeats—in full view of the guests, most of whom are Linda&amp;#39;s superiors at work—until Linda agrees. And when she does, it’s not with resentment, but with a doe-eyed smile full of adoration for this man who just bullied her into marrying him. Now, I ask you, who’s worse: the ass or the woman who reinforces the behavior?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going to write something about the ending, and how it lacks a clear message, leaving you wondering just what the film was trying to say, but why bother? There’s only one way to enjoy &lt;em&gt;Men Are Such Fools&lt;/em&gt;: 1. Start the movie. 2. Fast-forward to Bogart’s introduction. 3. Laugh at his outfit. 4. Turn off the movie. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>Green Room (2015)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/green-room-2015//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/green-room-2015/</id><updated>2017-01-23</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/green-room-2015/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hayyDsBD5mYl1ENR33mRoFHxFiDsfymKujeodQff-O8iWjBZpcMcpeKNSFcPXpjYZTyzjeHjhlxyXRlJEu65En1Egpzibw8QY3K4lk8bdwyTrRrcqEvdJAWMzEh_Pvva0TU46Q=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching &lt;em&gt;Green Room&lt;/em&gt;, I caught myself holding my breath. It&amp;#39;s that kind of movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story concerns a college-aged punk rock band who accept a gig at an out-of-the-way club in the Pacific Northwest. I&amp;#39;ll reveal no more, lest I spoil how writer/director Jeremy Saulnier ratchets up the tension by raising the stakes with each plot twist. Suffice it to say, things get very bad, very fast for the young band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Green Room&lt;/em&gt; is Saulnier&amp;#39;s third film. His debut, &lt;em&gt;Murder Party (2007)&lt;/em&gt;, was a flawed but entertaining black comedy. His follow-up, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/blue-ruin-2013/&quot;&gt;Blue Ruin (2013)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, was a near-perfect revenge thriller. With &lt;em&gt;Green Room&lt;/em&gt;, he delivers one of the more intense horror films I&amp;#39;ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the moment the band turns into the club&amp;#39;s parking lot, we feel uneasy. A palpable sense of menace hangs in the air. It grows as the kids make their way inside the club. By the time they take the stage, it&amp;#39;s overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesser horror films force their characters to behave in service of the plot. We spend such films yelling “Get out of the house!” or something similar at the idiots on screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Green Room&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t do this. Saulnier&amp;#39;s characters behave true to their established personalities. The kids sense something&amp;#39;s off, but they stay anyway. In part because they&amp;#39;re desperate for cash, but more so because they love playing music, and the film conveys the transcendent joy they experience on stage. Later, when things turn bad, the kids continue to react in a plausible and relatable manner. They don&amp;#39;t panic or fall for obvious traps. They play it smart. Except—and here lies the film&amp;#39;s genius—Saulnier paints his villains even smarter. They don&amp;#39;t panic or make stupid mistakes either. It&amp;#39;s all so refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also gruesome. Saulnier punctuates his plot twists with sudden, brutal bursts of violence driven home with convincing practical effects. It&amp;#39;s not a gore-fest, but it&amp;#39;s not for the squeamish either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s because Saulnier makes sure we care about his characters. Good effects suspend disbelief but good storytelling generates empathy. Saulnier&amp;#39;s prior efforts demonstrated a knack for creating flawed but endearing protagonists and quickly fleshing them out without resorting to awkward exposition or trite visuals. In &lt;em&gt;Green Room&lt;/em&gt;, he gives us a whole band full. He even avoids gender stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that I have not mentioned the cast. They&amp;#39;re all convincing and engaging, but discussing specific performances, or even the casting itself would invite spoilers. That said, I&amp;#39;ll make one exception since the film&amp;#39;s promotional artwork includes him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How I envy the festival audiences who went in knowing little more than the film&amp;#39;s title and director. Patrick Stewart&amp;#39;s reveal as a neo-Nazi gang leader must have been a terrific surprise. He&amp;#39;s an unconventional choice, but he pulls off the part. Granted, he&amp;#39;s not as scary as say, Ben Kingsley in &lt;em&gt;Sexy Beast (2000)&lt;/em&gt; or Stacy Keach in &lt;em&gt;American History X (1998)&lt;/em&gt;, but maybe that&amp;#39;s a good thing. &lt;em&gt;Green Room&lt;/em&gt; is intense enough.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the third production, following &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/ride-him-cowboy-1932/&quot;&gt;Ride Him, Cowboy (1932)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, under a six-picture contract John Wayne signed with Warner Bros. It&amp;#39;s a remake of &lt;em&gt;The Land Beyond the Law (1927)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Warner Bros. acquired First National Pictures a few years prior, they inherited the rights to several popular silent westerns starring Ken Maynard. These were A-list productions showcasing Maynard&amp;#39;s impressive stunt work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warner Bros. sought to remake the Maynard silents with sound, recycling as much action footage as possible, reshooting only the close-ups and interiors. They just needed an actor who matched Maynard&amp;#39;s build. Enter Wayne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except, &lt;em&gt;The Big Stampede&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t offer much action. Wayne plays John Steele, a deputy lawman sent to clean up the New Mexico territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He arrives in town and poses as a drunken drifter while sizing up local cattle baron Sam Crew. Then John is on the frontier, befriending a wagon train leader named Cal and making eyes at Cal&amp;#39;s niece Ginger. Then the train comes under attack from Sam Crew&amp;#39;s gang. To apprehend the gang, John recruits Sonora Joe, a Mexican bandit who first tries to rustle the wagon train&amp;#39;s cattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this sounds disjointed, then I have conveyed the sense of watching this film. The script abandons plot threads with no regard for logic or continuity. It also contains an inordinate number of speaking parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which begs the question: If the point of remaking the Maynard films was to save money, why shoot such a complex and talky script? Casting and shooting so much new footage cost time and money. The only memorable bit of recycled footage is the titular stampede, which provides the film&amp;#39;s climax. The wide shots of rampaging cattle and runaway wagons impress. The spliced in close-ups of Wayne shouting things like “Hoo-ah!” do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Wayne, like much of the cast, he appears ill at ease. His scenes with Mae Madison, who plays Ginger, are stiff and awkward. Only Luis Alberni, who plays Sonora Joe, acquits himself well; though hardly well enough to recommend this dull mess.

&lt;p&gt;What is a caper? It&amp;#39;s a film centered on an elaborate ruse perpetrated by lovable rogues. The genre peaked with &lt;em&gt;The Sting (1973)&lt;/em&gt;, then gave way to the grittier heist genre. But while heists get bloody, capers are rarely life-and-death scenarios. Today, the caper picture lies largely forgotten, save the occasional farcical comedy. But director Steven Soderbergh proves the old genre has legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This film&amp;#39;s lovable rogues come together to avenge their mentor (Elliott Gould) who&amp;#39;s been double-crossed by casino mogul Willy Bank (Al Pacino).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get even, the group plans to rob Bank&amp;#39;s casino. The film&amp;#39;s joy lies in how they go about it. The casino&amp;#39;s security system offers only a three-and-a-half minute window. To circumvent this obstacle, the group will rig the games to pay out to everyone. The group needn&amp;#39;t win, just for the casino to lose. So, for three-and-a-half minutes, everybody wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, folks don&amp;#39;t leave when they&amp;#39;re running hot and if they stay, they&amp;#39;ll just lose back their winnings. The thieves&amp;#39; solution to this dilemma provides another of the film&amp;#39;s quirky surprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lesser film might drag under such plotting, but &lt;em&gt;Ocean&amp;#39;s Thirteen&lt;/em&gt; breezes along, thanks to its all-star cast. Opposite Pacino, George Clooney and Brad Pitt star as the lead thieves with Matt Damon as their de facto lieutenant. Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Carl Reiner, and Eddie Izzard round out the crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performers relish the script&amp;#39;s rapid-fire dialogue. Peppered with invented slang and meta references, it&amp;#39;s the film&amp;#39;s biggest treat, and holds up to repeat viewings. The first scene between Clooney and Pacino, with Clooney echoing Pacino&amp;#39;s dialog from &lt;em&gt;The Godfather (1972)&lt;/em&gt; always makes me smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my favorite scene is audacious. It opens with Pitt and Clooney strolling along the Las Vegas Strip, reminiscing. They stop and Clooney gestures off-camera, saying, “I remember when this used to be the Dunes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pitt looks down the street, “The Sands was there, and the Desert Inn…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to a close-up. Both men stand lost in their memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clooney says, “They built them a lot smaller back then.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pitt, still looking where The Sands once stood, says, almost to himself, “They seemed pretty big.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another beat, then Clooney says, “Towns change,” and Soderbergh cuts to a wide shot reveal of the Bellagio dwarfing Clooney and Pitt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this scene. Such self-indulgence should elicit a groan, but between the crackerjack editing and sheer charisma of his stars, Soderbergh gets away with it. It&amp;#39;s a caper-within-a-caper and I fall for it every viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: A-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
