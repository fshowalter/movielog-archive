&lt;p&gt;The plot is vintage 80&amp;#39;s slasher. Years earlier, a small Nova Scotian mining town saw a cave-in trap several miners. The men on watch were AWOL at a Valentine&amp;#39;s Day party, forcing the lone survivor to resort to cannibalism. Following his rescue, the survivor donned his mining gear and murdered the negligent men. The town hasn&amp;#39;t celebrated Valentine&amp;#39;s Day since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash-forward. A fresh group of young miners and their girlfriends want to have a Valentine&amp;#39;s Day party. Unbeknownst to them, someone wearing a miner&amp;#39;s outfit has begun offing locals. The mayor and sheriff keep the killings under wraps and cancel the party. The frustrated miners move the party to the mine. Soon, the youngsters find themselves trapped underground with the killer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th (1980)&lt;/em&gt;, the story revolves around a tragedy of neglect born of indulgence. In a subtle nod, the film sets Valentine&amp;#39;s Day on a Saturday, making the preceding Friday the 13th. Like &lt;em&gt;Halloween (1978)&lt;/em&gt; it features a holiday theme. But &lt;em&gt;My Bloody Valentine&lt;/em&gt; eschews wooded cabins or suburban homes and substitutes a dank, dark, coal mine. It&amp;#39;s an inspired choice that works thanks to the location photography. Another inspired choice is the script&amp;#39;s allowance for multiple survivors. By avoiding the &amp;quot;final girl&amp;quot; trope, the film avoids the contrived plotting that goes into whittling a group, despite the natural human impulse to stick together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as an 80&amp;#39;s slasher, the only things working against the film are the Nova Scotian accents. To me, they sound too cheerful and polite, giving the film an unintentional satirical tone.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Harry in Your Pocket&lt;/em&gt;, James Coburn plays the titular Harry, a professional pick-pocket. He operates with Casey, an aging crook played by Walter Pidgeon. The plot follows a young couple who join Harry and Casey to form a wire mob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wire mob is an organized team of pick-pockets. Though we never learn the mechanics of pick-pocketing, we learn the lingo. A spotter directs stalls to distract the mark for the cannon who passes the poke to the drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gang travels from Seattle up to British Columbia then down to Salt Lake City. They board in the finest hotels and dine in the finest restaurants, their lifestyle financed by Harry via strangers&amp;#39; wallets. I appreciated the elegant way the film presented the bleak truth: what can Harry do with the money but spend it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, Coburn&amp;#39;s Harry proves an enigma. We learn little about him yet he remains relentlessly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, the film isn&amp;#39;t about Harry, it&amp;#39;s about Ray and Sandy, the young stalls who join Harry&amp;#39;s gang. Thanks to Trish Van Devere&amp;#39;s performance, I could buy Sandy as a detached thrill seeker, but Michael Sarrazin&amp;#39;s performance as Ray left me impatient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devoid of any edge, Sarrazin plays Ray as a generic nice guy who&amp;#39;d prefer a 9-to-5 job and a house in the suburbs. When Ray&amp;#39;s alone on screen, the film drags. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I liked the movie. Chalk it up to Coburn. He&amp;#39;s so interesting to watch, he makes mediocre movies good, and good movies great. &lt;em&gt;Harry in Your Pocket&lt;/em&gt; is closer to mediocre, but Coburn makes it worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>The Thin Man (1934)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-thin-man-1934//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-thin-man-1934/</id><updated>2017-07-03</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-thin-man-1934/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ek2enRnmczLjh5MV6UcLqV5MBaReqGpXxgfE1OY3U7kRLgS5tIaMRGm15Oeyq3I2MtSz7VmBnV9L2e448JbtyLQaRWWQEW_a22rB-MnzgUYaUpwnNQG3dmBaPl9nDbZjdRZc-w=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Thin Man&lt;/em&gt; drags at first, but give it a chance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It opens with eccentric inventor Clyde Wynant preparing to go into seclusion to work on a new project. He&amp;#39;s interrupted by a visit from his daughter Dorothy who announces her engagement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wynant hurries Dorothy out but promises to return in time for her wedding. Wynant continues his preparations but finds the $50,000 in bonds he&amp;#39;d earmarked as a wedding present to Dorothy have gone missing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wynant storms over to his mistress Julia&amp;#39;s apartment and catches her in another man&amp;#39;s arms. Wynant accuses Julia of stealing the bonds and threatens to turn her over to the police. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three months later, Dorothy hasn&amp;#39;t heard from her father. While out at a restaurant, she recognizes former detective Nick Charles, played by William Powell, and approaches him for help. Nick declines, citing his new life of leisure with his heiress wife Nora, played by Myrna Loy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when circumstances pin a pair of murders on the still missing Wynant, Nick steps in, uncovering a buried skeleton and a labyrinthine array of suspects and motives. The mystery culminates with New York&amp;#39;s finest corralling everyone to a dinner party where Nick reveals the true killer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talky opening betrays the film&amp;#39;s B-movie production. It&amp;#39;s a stiff ten minutes but don&amp;#39;t worry. Once Powell makes his appearance—in a posh bar showing an impromptu crowd how various cocktails demand unique shaking rhythms (Manhattans a Fox-Trot, Bronxs a Two-Step, and Dry Martinis a Waltz)—everything changes. The dialog shifts from stilted exposition to witty banter as Powell glides through the film as the witty urbane charmer we believe ourselves to be after a few drinks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script offers little real danger and the entire plot proves little more than a MacGuffin to support his lyrical banter, which reaches its apex during the iconic dinner party scene. As Nora says, “It&amp;#39;s the best dinner I&amp;#39;ve ever listened to.”&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After chewing him out for being a drunken womanizer, Wallace&amp;#39;s father puts him to work collecting a debt owed by a minister. Wallace falls for the minister&amp;#39;s daughter, Marion, played by top-billed Evelyn Knapp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film&amp;#39;s first half sees Wallace pursue Marion. The two marry, which causes a rift between Wallace and his father, who views Marion as a gold digger despite never meeting her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marion goes to the elder Wallace to smooth things over, but a mix-up lands her hired as his secretary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early scenes with John Wayne as a drunken playboy checking out women&amp;#39;s ankles in his rearview mirror had me laughing. They&amp;#39;re almost enough to recommend the film. But the lack of chemistry between Wayne and Knapp, and the awkward third-act plotting, reserve &lt;em&gt;His Private Secretary&lt;/em&gt; for Wayne die-hards only.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months back, I gave &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/island-of-death-1977/&quot;&gt;Island of Death (1977)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; a four-star review, praising its “everything-but-the-kitchen sink approach that pushes the film past any genuine scares or mean-spirited umbrage, and firmly into parody.” &lt;em&gt;Giallo a Venezia&lt;/em&gt; opens with a similar vibe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We meet an improbably coiffed police detective inspecting the murder of a married couple, Fabio and Flavia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the case unwinds, we learn Fabio was a sex fiend. In a series of flashbacks, he pushes Flavia to engage in escalating deviant behavior. First simple voyeurism, but soon he&amp;#39;s whipping her, encouraging strangers to grope her, and her to grope strangers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whipping bit had me laughing. The scene starts with Fabio and Flavia in bed. She tries to engage him, kissing and fondling him, but he&amp;#39;s bored and soon retires to another room where he thumbs through a book of erotic drawings. Still looking at the drawings, Fabio snorts a sizable amount of cocaine. The combination enacts a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transformation that sees him return to Flavia, cat-o-nine-tails in hand, and wail on her. She screams which only excites him further, and soon he&amp;#39;s forcing himself into an uncomfortable place. Played straight, the scene would be painful, but it&amp;#39;s so over-the-top, it&amp;#39;s hard to take seriously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But instead of embracing the ridiculous, the film doubles down on misogyny. A mysterious killer offs a prostitute and some friends of Fabio and Flavia. The murders—particularly the prostitute&amp;#39;s—are uninspired and ugly. The film gets progressively meaner, culminating in a gang-rape scene I found hard to watch. &lt;em&gt;Giallo a Venezia&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#39;t crazy enough to entertain and lacks any thoughts to provoke. It&amp;#39;s just rubbing our noses in a series of obnoxious scenes it believes pass for edgy drama.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>The Ghoul (1933)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-ghoul-1933//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/the-ghoul-1933/</id><updated>2017-06-12</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-ghoul-1933/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GfPDGVCpp5mYVL-WLq7e-qfMaTu91UxP_P-hRwLuSZmUSVmm84Xz-scVA37pgP27Bzv5JqMwleVYv0wrDZqC3E75U5MARmam4iD0rJZMIrG7hMVAgtHH7T4uTN5Nl0BjKI2rXA=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the most ardent Boris Karloff fan can skip &lt;em&gt;The Ghoul&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a bait and switch. The opening sees Karloff playing an ailing, disfigured Egyptologist. Bedridden in a gloomy mansion, he details the conditions for his entombment following his imminent death. It&amp;#39;s a good setup, and the funeral scene that follows has us pumped for some undead action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these scenes appear tacked on to capitalize on Karloff&amp;#39;s prior box office successes: &lt;em&gt;The Mummy (1932)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Old Dark House (1932)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the title, &lt;em&gt;The Ghoul&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#39;t a horror film. With Karloff off-screen, the film devolves into a tedious mystery. A slew of characters turn up searching for a rare jewel stolen from Karloff&amp;#39;s tomb. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the supporting cast&amp;#39;s flat delivery and stiff dialog, following the convoluted plot proves an ordeal. The overbearing score doesn&amp;#39;t help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, the cobwebbed sets and shadowy photography create a rich gothic atmosphere, but the film fails to exploit it. When Karloff finally returns for the film&amp;#39;s final third as the titular ghoul, he&amp;#39;s far from terrifying. Creeping around like a dim-witted zombie, he seems as bored as we are.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry><title>Casablanca (1942)</title><link href='https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/casablanca-1942//' /><id>https://www.franksmovielog.com/reviews/casablanca-1942/</id><updated>2017-06-05</updated><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/casablanca-1942/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d1dVVcIG3eIy7M0F4k64jbkOV_jrOcp6_U3tY-zVC8547wbCjOkt3Zo350K55V0BL-SMfXjHYCyYCzXab13bxQbXyvqhqzaASve5KksyEPNH5pfPdJ2bOfWAqODqxiyQ7dGcxA=w1000-l75-rj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time I watched &lt;em&gt;Casablanca&lt;/em&gt;, I already knew every line of dialog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my senior year of high school, I worked at Suncoast Video. It wasn&amp;#39;t a rental store, but one that sold VHS and Laserdisc movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On monitors mounted throughout the store we&amp;#39;d show whatever clamshelled, family-friendly title corporate was pushing—think &lt;em&gt;Free Willy (1993)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the holiday season, corporate would ship washing-machine-sized boxes of product for us to stock. Nothing stayed in the back room so we&amp;#39;d be there—well past midnight—stacking copies of &lt;em&gt;The Bodyguard (1992)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sister Act (1992)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we worked, we&amp;#39;d put on a movie. The monitors would be off, but we&amp;#39;d listen. &lt;em&gt;Casablanca&lt;/em&gt; proved an employee favorite on those long nights. Though I&amp;#39;d never seen it, I loved the crackling dialog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca and the Germans have outlawed miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story takes place during World War II. Casablanca, an unoccupied French colony, has become a purgatory for European refugees looking to escape to America. We meet Rick, an American expatriate played by Humphrey Bogart. He runs the most popular cafe in town. As Louis, the venal Prefect of Police played by Claude Rains says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody comes to Rick&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Rick&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re entertained by Sam, a piano playing singer played by Dooley Wilson. Aside from Sam and the cafe, Rick maintains a cool detachment from everything and everyone. That changes once long-lost flame Ilsa (played by Ingrid Bergman) walks in on the arm of Victor Lazlo, a resistance leader wanted by the Germans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing Ilsa shakes Rick from his isolationist stance, and soon he&amp;#39;s abetting the local resistance. The Germans retaliate by insisting Louis shut down the cafe. Amid the chaos of the police chasing everyone out, Rick demands an explanation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOUIS&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;#39;m shocked, SHOCKED, to find gambling going on here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(A croupier approaches with a large wad of cash)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CROUPIER&lt;br&gt;
Your winnings sir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOUIS&lt;br&gt;
Oh, thank you, very much!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not just funny, it&amp;#39;s Billy Wilder funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the film pivots with ease. Grounded in relatable emotions, the melodrama packs a punch. Consider how Rick spits venom at Ilsa:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess neither one of our stories is very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Lazlo, or were there others in between or… aren&amp;#39;t you the kind that tells?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No weepy speeches, just relatable emotion setup by an earlier scene between a drunken Rick and Sam:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAM&lt;br&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s get outta here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RICK&lt;br&gt;
No Sam, I&amp;#39;m waiting for a lady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAM&lt;br&gt;
Please boss, let&amp;#39;s go. Ain&amp;#39;t nothing but trouble for you here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RICK (staring at the liquor in front of him)&lt;br&gt;
She&amp;#39;s coming back. I know she&amp;#39;s coming back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAM&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;#39;ll take the car. We&amp;#39;ll drive all night. We&amp;#39;ll get drunk. We&amp;#39;ll go fishing and stay away until she&amp;#39;s gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RICK (not looking at Sam)&lt;br&gt;
Shut up and go home, will ya?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAM&lt;br&gt;
No sir, I&amp;#39;m staying right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great lines abound but some of the film&amp;#39;s best moments are visual. I didn&amp;#39;t discover them until years later, when I finally sat down and watched the film. Nice touches like when the waiter checks his pockets after the pickpocket bumps him. Or the beat-perfect editing between Rick and Louis during the finale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let&amp;#39;s talk about that ending. It&amp;#39;s not a happy one. Rick sends the love of his life away and goes off to a likely death. Noble? Absolutely. But in an era where studios were allergic to unhappy endings, it&amp;#39;s amazing this one went over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, it&amp;#39;s impressive how the script doesn&amp;#39;t have Ilsa waffle, even when she believes Rick has betrayed Victor. This casts her in an unflattering light, but gives the ending its resonance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a movie buff before &lt;em&gt;Casablanca&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#39;s what got me the video store job. But &lt;em&gt;Casablanca&lt;/em&gt; made me a Bogart fan, which led me to &lt;em&gt;The Big Sleep (1946)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Maltese Falcon (1941)&lt;/em&gt;, which led me to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews/the-thin-man-1934/&quot;&gt;The Thin Man (1934)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, along with the films of John Huston and Howard Hawks, which led me to the films of William Powell and John Wayne, which led me to &lt;em&gt;Rio Bravo (1959)&lt;/em&gt;, and well… you get the idea. &lt;em&gt;Casablanca&lt;/em&gt; changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m not alone. Roger Ebert considered &lt;em&gt;Casablanca&lt;/em&gt; his favorite movie. What higher recommendation can I offer?&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: A+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film opens during the final moments of &lt;em&gt;Man of Steel (2013)&lt;/em&gt;. We follow Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne rushing through the chaotic streets of Metropolis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overhead, Superman battles Zod—a Kryptonian bent on wiping out humanity. The two aliens crash through buildings and unleash arcs of laser-like heat vision. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Bruce approaches Wayne Enterprises&amp;#39; Metropolis office, Superman and Zod rip through the building like a bullet. The skyscraper topples, sending out a massive cloud of debris. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People scream. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emergency responders freeze. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruce Wayne runs toward the destruction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the dust clears, Bruce snatches little girl from the path of some falling debris. He crouches down and looks in her wide eyes. “It&amp;#39;s going to be okay,” he says. “We&amp;#39;re going to find your mom. Where is she? Where&amp;#39;s your mom?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girl points—her arm shaking—toward the smoldering rubble of the Wayne tower. Bruce pulls the girl close and glares up—eyes full of rage—at Superman and Zod still zooming through the air. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that shot, any apprehension I had about Affleck evaporated. He&amp;#39;s not wearing the suit, but he&amp;#39;s Batman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this sequence&amp;#39;s accomplishments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It summarizes and even provides the payoff for the excessive destruction sequences of the prior film. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sells Affleck in the role of Batman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It establishes motivation for the conflict between the titular characters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this with near-constant action and no exposition. It&amp;#39;s an amazing sequence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it also commits the film&amp;#39;s most egregious sin: it raises our expectations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, the film devolves into a mess of dead-end plot threads and superfluous characters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some had potential. Holly Hunter plays a US Senator chairing a hearing discussing Superman&amp;#39;s unchecked role in global affairs. We&amp;#39;re given an iconic image of Superman hovering outside the Capitol building, before symbolically landing and walking inside. What followed should have been crackling, character-driven drama. Instead, the building blows up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This explosion comes courtesy of Lex Luthor, played by Jessie Eisenberg as an eccentric young industrialist. He blows up the Capitol because—well, mostly because the script feels stitched together. Luthor manipulates Superman and Batman into fighting one another because—well, see above. Luthor also creates a giant monster because… well, you get the idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other characters and scenes exist solely to set up the next films in the franchise. We meet Wonder Woman. She&amp;#39;s superfluous to the story, but proves a compelling character, largely because she&amp;#39;s devoid of angst. We also get awkward teases for Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there&amp;#39;s so much going on, I can&amp;#39;t imagine someone following it all without having read the comics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How else to recognize the small, but important bits of characterization? Like how Joker&amp;#39;s murdering Robin lead to this film&amp;#39;s more brutal Batman. Or bigger bits, like uber-villain Darkseid&amp;#39;s Omega sigil in Bruce&amp;#39;s apocalyptic vision and how Luthor&amp;#39;s ramblings in the finale reference Darkseid&amp;#39;s mother box technology. Reading between the lines, Luthor was little more than Renfield to Darkseid&amp;#39;s Dracula. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But relying on the viewer&amp;#39;s prior exposure to the characters invites preconceived notions of who these characters should be. And I can&amp;#39;t imagine anyone familiar with the Superman mythos getting behind this version of Luthor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we haven&amp;#39;t even covered the inanity of a script that sees Batman murder criminals and cause the same wanton destruction that so enraged him during the film&amp;#39;s opening sequence. Consider Batman, in his plane, leading a monster back to the city so he can retrieve a weapon that might kill it. Why not fly back, grab the weapon, then battle the monster in relative isolation? Because the movie isn&amp;#39;t interested in making sense. It&amp;#39;s too busy trying to build a franchise.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: D+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The catchy folk-rock theme song? That surprised me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, the film&amp;#39;s IMDb page has no trivia. No proof the American distributor already owned the song, spliced it into the soundtrack, and changed the film&amp;#39;s title. Nope, none at all. So, clearly, director Mario Gariazzo commissioned the theme, believing it a perfect tonal fit. If that&amp;#39;s true, it might merit an extra star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film&amp;#39;s plot concerns a blackmail scam photographing wealthy marks in compromising positions in the titular establishment. Said positions feature lots of nudity and kinky behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, a black-gloved killer starts picking off victims peripheral to the scam. After the killer stashes a body in a parked car&amp;#39;s trunk, the car&amp;#39;s owners, a young couple, get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the local police&amp;#39;s urging, the couple turns amateur sleuths, a questionable decision that sees the wife pose nude for a sleazy photographer while her husband waits in the car. When she&amp;#39;s inevitably captured and beaten, he&amp;#39;s laughably unconcerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all plays out as an over-the-top cross between Scooby-Doo and softcore porn. The end reveal is laugh-out-loud implausible, and the blackmail scenes are as explicit as the censors would allow. It&amp;#39;s pure exploitation in all it&amp;#39;s ridiculous glory and I&amp;#39;ll admit, it kept me entertained. If sleazy giallos are your thing, &lt;em&gt;Play Motel&lt;/em&gt; won&amp;#39;t disappoint.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My heels rise. The balls of my feet press into the floor. My hands clench tight and I realize I&amp;#39;m holding my breath. &lt;em&gt;Heat&lt;/em&gt; on the big screen is an experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen the film several times, yet the centerpiece shootout scene in the streets of downtown Los Angeles always elicits a visceral reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boiled down, it&amp;#39;s a cops and robbers story. Robert De Niro leads a crew of professional thieves taking down a series of Los Angeles scores. Al Pacino leads the cops in pursuit. They&amp;#39;re archetypes in the Howard Hawks tradition—professions personified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, &lt;em&gt;Heat&lt;/em&gt; feels like a Hawks picture, right down to the underwritten female characters. But while Hawks romanticized the professional, &lt;em&gt;Heat&lt;/em&gt; shows us the cost of such a lifestyle. De Niro plans the heists with military precision, yet lives alone in a palatial seaside estate that could pass for vacant. Pacino hunts De Niro&amp;#39;s crew with obsessive fervor, even as his third marriage crumbles around him. Both performances feel larger than life yet intensely human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to the shootout. It makes the movie. The scene carries an immense gravitas because everything about it feels authentic. From the way the characters fire short bursts and reload, to their tactical movements, it all resonates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not to say writer/director Michael Mann values authenticity over drama. His kinetic editing includes plenty of long and wide shots to establish movement and geography, immersing us in the scene. We don&amp;#39;t witness the gunfight we &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: A+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
