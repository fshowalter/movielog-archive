This is probably my bad. Are you looking for one of my old reviews? I'm in the process of touching them up
and reposting them. In the mean time, you can find them in the site's <a href="https://github.com/fshowalter/movielog/tree/master/drafts">GitHub repo</a>.

If that's not what you're after, you can try searching below:
<div class="not_found-search">
  <form action="https://www.google.com/search" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="get">
    <input type="hidden" name="q" value="site:www.franksmovielog.com">
    <input type="text" name="q" placeholder="What are you looking for?" class="not_found-search_input">
  </form>
</div>

If you still can't find what you need, contact me via <a href="http://twitter.com/FranksMovieLog">Twitter</a> and I'll try and help.

My apologies, and thanks for stopping by.
