    Hi there. I'm Frank. This site is a catalog of my movie-watching adventures. I keep a searchable <a href='/viewings/'>viewing log</a> where I track everything I see, and I try to review as much as I can. If you're curious about the star ratings, I wrote a piece on <a href='/features/how-i-grade/'>how I grade</a>. Once upon a time, I reviewed everything I watched, but these days I aim for quality over quantity. Iâ€™m not a great writer. Maybe not even a good one. But with practice I can be better.
