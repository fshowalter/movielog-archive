    Hi there. I'm Frank. This site is a catalog of my movie-watching adventures. I keep a searchable <a href='/viewings/' data-no-carnac>viewing log</a> where I track everything I see.
    <br />
    <br />
    Once upon a time, I reviewed everything I watched, but these days I aim for quality over quantity. Iâ€™m not a great writer. Maybe not even a good one. But with practice I can be better.
